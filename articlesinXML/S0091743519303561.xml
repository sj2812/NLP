               Abstract
               
                  Background
                  Large scale United States (US) surveys guide efforts to maximize the health of its population. Cervical cancer screening is an effective preventive measure with a consistent question format among surveys. The aim of this study is to describe the predictors of cervical cancer screening in older women as reported by three national surveys.
               
               
                  Methods
                  The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS 2016), the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 2017), and the Health Center Patient Survey (HCPS 2014) were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. We defined the cohort as women, without hysterectomy, who were 45–65 years old. The primary outcome was cytology within the last 3 years.
               
               
                  Results
                  Overall, Pap screening rates were 71% (BRFSS), 79% (HINTS) and 66% (HCPS), among 41,657, 740 and 1571 women, respectively. BRFSS showed that women 60–64 years old (aPR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.91), and in rural locations (aPR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.98) were significantly less likely to report cervical cancer screening than women 45–49-years old or in urban locations. Compared to less than high school, women with more education reported more screening (aPR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.28), and those with insurance had higher screening rates than the uninsured (aPR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.62). HINTS and HCPS also showed these trends.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  All three surveys show that cervical cancer screening rates in women 45–65 years are insufficient to reduce cervical cancer incidence. Insurance is the major positive predictor of screening, followed by younger age and more education. Race/ethnicity are variable predictors depending on the survey.

Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 7    Introduction  National health goals for the United States (US) were established in 1979 through the  Healthy People initiative [1].  Currently, the Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) goals are to  decrease cervical cancer incidence to 7.3/100,000 women [2]. In order to do this, a minimum  70% population participation level in cervical cancer screening is needed [3, 4].  The HP2020  goal is a 93% cervical cancer screening rate among women without hysterectomies [2] with  screening technique and interval informed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force  (USPSTF) guidelines [5].    The age at which cervical cancer screening occurs has a significant impact on the  likelihood of developing invasive cervical cancer [6]. Younger women have significantly less  impact on cancer incidence than do women screened at 45 years or older regardless of the  screening interval or the testing technique [7- 9].  Screening under 30 years of age is considered  the most expensive and least effective [10- 12].  Screening of women over 42 years provides up  to an 80% protective effect [6, 9] against cervical cancer detection at the next screen.  Hence,  we focus our work on the self-reported screening rates of 45-65 years old women in the United  States.    The large scale self-reported health surveys query the health of the US population at  measured intervals to evaluate policy goals and to set future targets.  Hamilton et al [13] led an  effort to harmonize cancer screening questions, using similar constructs (question stems) but  allowing correlate domains to be adaptable to each surveyâ€™s population and purpose.  Over  time, the cancer screening c nstructs around cervical cancer screening have converged to the  same language and offered appropriate evidence-based options for a response around Pap  testing, minimizing response variation due to construct variation [14].    Predictors of screening identified from other surveys include age, geolocation, insurance  status, education and race [15-18].  The significance of the predictors varies depending both on  the survey and the cycle of the survey.  For instance, historically, the association of education  and cervical cancer screening has varied.  The 2013 Health Information National Trends Survey  (HINTS) indicated education was not a predictor of cervical cancer screening uptake [16];  neither did the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) [17].  But, the earlier  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 8    2012 BRFSS data [19] showed that increased education was associated with greater likelihood  of screening. Compared to â€˜high school or lessâ€™, some college was associated with a 38% higher  likelihood of screening and a college graduate was 2.23 times as likely to be screened.  While  the constructs of how cervical cancer screening questions have been harmonized, the variation  in response rates is still substantial among surveys.  Discordant results may lead to confusion in  policy recommendations leaving certain populations at risk and others over-screened.  The  Health Center Patient Survey (HCPS) focuses particularly on low income health recipients who  represent many of the characteristics seen among women under-screened for cervical cancer.   This unique database has recently been released for public analysis.    The primary aim of this study is to explore the recent self-reported cervical cancer  screening rates of older women, 45-65 years, in two representative US databases (BRFSS,  HINTS) and one new database (HCPS) to describe if the predictors of cervical cancer screening  within the vulnerable HCPS population differ from those derived from the BRFSS or HINTS  populations.   Methods  National health surveys.  BRFSS [20] is a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-developed health- related telephone survey that is designed to collect disease prevalence and state-level risk  factor data on adults in all 50 states and District of Columbia in order to establish health related  policies and priorities at the local level.  Individual state health departments conduct landline  and cell phone interviews with representative citizens to gather self-reported health risk  behaviors, the receipt of clinical preventive services and access to health care. Weighting of the  raw data is based on the number of phones in each household such that the BRFSS population  is representative of gender, age, race, education, marital status, and home ownership, in state  and sub-state regions.  The most recent BRFSS dataset, including the health care access  module, available for our analysis is 2016.    HINTS was created by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and  Population Sciences (DCCPS) to monitor changes in the field of cancer-related health  communications [21]. It has been used to understand how adults use different communication  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 9    channels to access information about cancer risk factors, screening, and care in the US.   Questionnaires are mailed to home addresses including high density housing (e.g. public  housing) which are oversampled by design.  The questionnaire includes a $2 pre-paid incentive;  reminder postcards are mailed up to three times.  Weighting, calibration and adjustments are  applied such that HINTS is representative of the US population by age, gender, education,  marital status, race, ethnicity and census region.  Each HINTS is administered in four cycles over  four years; we used HINTS 5 cycle 1 (2017).    The Health Resources and Services Administrationâ€™s (HRSA) Bureau of Primary Health  Care (BPHC) is responsible for the oversight of the Health Center Programs under Section 330 of  the Public Health Services Act [22].  Vulnerable populations cared for by Section 330 funding  health care are 15% of the uninsured, 15% of Medicaid recipients and 7% of the entire US  population [23]. The HCPS is gathered every five years from an in-person, one-on-one interview  with people who are nationally representative of the Health Center Program patient  population.  The data are used to improve health center performance/quality improvement and  operational efficiencies; and to identify health conditions, behaviors, and trends of vulnerable  populations over time by comparison to the US population as a whole. In addition, the HCPS  queries patientsâ€™ access to and satisfaction with health care. The 2014 dataset is the first and  most recent HCPS released to the public and was used in our work. The sampling frames of  each survey are presented in Figure 1 and the constructs of the surveys are in Supplemental  Table 1.    Demographics and predictors of screening.  In our study we included women aged 45- 65 years with no known history of uterine or cervical cancer, and who had not had a  hysterectomy.  Unlike BRFSS and HINTS, HCPS did not ask for specific cancer history so all  women in the specified age range were included. All surveys used a common categorization of  race and ethnicity: Hispanic, non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black (NHB), and other  women of non-Hispanic (NH) ethnicity. Across all three surveys, educational status was  categorized as less than high school, high school graduate, more than high school. Geographical  identification was described differently across all three surveys.  For BRFSS data we combined  center of city metropolitan statistical area (MSA), same county as MSA center city and suburban  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 10    county of MSA into â€œurbanâ€� and not in an MSA as â€œruralâ€� as has been described by the National  Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification Scheme [24, 25].  For HINTS data we  combined large metro, large fringe metro and medium metro into â€œurbanâ€� and small metro,  micropolitan and non-metro into â€œruralâ€� using the same classification scheme [25].  For HCPS  data, urban and rural were the only categories defined.  Insurance status (insured vs.  uninsured) was used in the majority of analysis for all three surveys.  BRFSS collected  information on whether or not respondents had some form of health plan but did not identify  the source; HINTS and HCPS further categorized insurance source by employer/private, publicly  funded, or uninsured.  Employer/private and publicly funded were combined to create an  â€˜insuredâ€™ category when necessary.    Cervical cancer screening.  The primary technique for cervical cancer screening in this  study was cytology.  All three surveys queried about cytology screening: did the woman ever  have a Pap; and when did the last Pap occur.  A secondary indicator for cervical cancer  screening was human papillomavirus (HPV) testing.  Only BRFSS and HCPS queried about HPV  screening: did the woman have an HPV test; and when was the last HPV test.     Statistics.  Within each dataset, predictors of screening were summarized using  proportions, unweighted and weighted with a 95% confidence interval.  Cervical cancer  screening rates were calculated by determining whether individuals had received a Pap test  within the last 3 years.  For BRFSS, we summarized reported HPV screening rates within the last  5 years as a secondary guideline directed screening method.  Pap test and HPV screening rates  were compared in the BRFSS data using McNemarâ€™s test.  We performed pairwise comparisons  of screening rates using post-hoc marginal probability estimates obtained from logistic  regression models for each predictor.  Adjustments were made to p-values using the Bonferroni  correction to account for multiple testing.  Interaction terms between age with race, education  and geolocation were tested with no significant findings, thus non-age stratified rates are  presented. Prevalence ratios comparing 5-year HPV screening rates between different groups  were estimated using binomial regression models with a log link.  Adjusted prevalence ratios for  Pap testing were estimated using Poisson models.  Covariates included age, race, insurance  status, geolocation and education. All datasets were analyzed using weighted sampling  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 11    methods to ensure valid inferences from the responding sample to the population, correcting  for non-response and non-coverage biases [26]. Weighting methods were specific to each  survey [27-29].  Results   Age groups were categorized by five-year intervals for BRFSS and HINTS with intervals of  interest starting at 45-49 years old; HCPS uses 10-year intervals (Table 1). All three surveys  reported similarly aging cohorts; but HINTS and HCPS reported lower enrollment of those over  55 years.  Rural and urban distributions were represented differently.  BRFSS respondents were  more urban than rural (35% vs 7%), but the majority failed to report any location (58%).  HINTS  was more urban than rural (79% vs. 21%) and HCPS was predominantly rural (60%).  While the  HCPS population was more equally distributed across levels of educational attainment, both the  BRFSS and HINTS populations had â€œmore than a high schoolâ€� education compared to â€œless than  a high schoolâ€� education (62% vs 13% and 70% vs 7%, respectively).  Racial and ethnic  representation was similar across all surveys, with the majority being NHW.  Both HINTS (26%)  and HCPS (30%) have a higher combined proportion of NHB and Hispanic respondents than  BRFSS (19%).  Insurance coverage varied across surveys as well; 90% of BRFSS respondents  reported some form of insurance without identifying private vs public sources. HINTS reported  more employer/private insurance than public or uninsured (67% vs 32%) and HCPS reported  more Medicaid/Medicare and uninsured populations than private (88% vs 12%).     Table 2 shows cervical cancer screening rates among women without a hysterectomy.   All survey constructs used the â€œwithin the last 3 yearsâ€� for current Pap testing, which  corresponds to guidelines for cytology screening alone in women 21-65 years [5].  Survey  constructs for HPV testing were aligned with current guidelines for BRFSS, with the option of  â€œwithin last 5 yearsâ€� for women older than 30 years.    Overall estimates of screening rates within the past 3 years were 71% (BRFSS), 79%  (HINTS) and 66% (HCPS).  Among those women who participated in Pap testing but at a longer  interval than guideline directed, HCPS reported twice the rate of longer interval participation  than did HINTS or BRFSS (30% vs. 15%/16%, respectively).  In BRFSS, HPV testing within the last  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 12    5 years significantly lagged Pap testing within the last 3 years by 49% (22% vs 71%, 95% CI of  the difference: 48.2-49.8).     Univariate analyses.  Figure 2 stratifies Pap screening within the last 3 years by five  groups:  age (A), geolocation (B), insurance (C) and educational attainment (D) and  race/ethnicity (E).  As age increases, Pap screening rates decreased across all three surveys.  Only the BRFSS data showed consistent and statistically significant decreases by age group from  75% for the youngest group to 68% for the oldest.  While HINTS showed point estimates of  screening rates above the 70% threshold and HCPS point estimates were at or below this 70%  threshold, both showed trends for decreased screening as age increases.    The three surveys similarly reported differences in screening rates by geolocation.  Urban respondents, regardless of survey, had rates higher than the 70% threshold.  Rural  respondents from HCPS reported the lowest screening rate or the surveys at 61%.    All three surveys showed that screening rates tended to be higher among insured  woman compared to the uninsured women, with BRFSS reporting the largest disparity (74% vs  52%, 95% CI of difference: 18.6-24.4) closely followed by the HCPS rates (71% insured vs 57%  uninsured, 95% CI of difference: 1.7-26.9).  While the overall screening rates differed between  HINTS (~80%) and HCPS (~70%), within each survey, similar screening rates were found for  public and privately insured women.   Increasing educational attainment led to significantly higher screening rates reported in  BRFSS (62% [less than high school] vs. 66% [high school graduation] vs. 76% [more than high  school], overall p &lt;0.001).  In HINTS, while the screening rates similarly trended upward, from  55% to 83%, for higher educational attainment, the trend was not significant.  The HCPS data,  on the other hand, showed relatively uniform screening rates by educational attainment  predominantly at or under the 70% threshold.     Pap screening rates were most strikingly different across surveys by race/ethnicity. In  BRFSS, NHW, NHB and Hispanic women reported screening at very similar rates, around 70%;  while the women of other NH ethnicities reported significantly lower screening rates (72%  (NHW) vs. 65% (women of other NH ethnicities), 95% CI of difference: 2.5-13.0).  In HINTS, all  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 13    racial/ethnic groups reported very similar rates above the 70% threshold, but far from the 93%  HP2020 goal.    By contrast, HCPS data showed that NHW women reported significantly lower screening  rates than each of the race/ethnicity categories by pairwise comparisons. All women who  receive health care from Section 330 Public Health funding have the option to go elsewhere for  Pap screening.  Among the subset who reported having received a recent Pap screening and  having it performed at a Health Center, 82% were within the 3-year guideline; whereas, if the  Pap screening was done elsewhere, 54% were within the 3-year guideline (95% CI of  difference:15.6-42.0).  Of those screened at the HCPS health center within the past 3 years, the  screening rate for Hispanic women was 92% (95% CI: 83-97), for NHB women 93% (95% CI: 86- 97) and for women of other NH races 95% (95% CI: (86-98).    Within BRFSS, of the 22% who reported HPV testing within the last 5 years, the adjusted  prevalence rates in Table 3 showed similar trends to Pap screening: lower rates were more  likely among older women, women living in rural areas, women with less education and  uninsured women.  HPV testing among women of different races/ethnicities differed from Pap  testing with NHB and Hispanic women have a higher likelihood of screening than NHW women.     Multivariate modeling. We calculated the adjusted prevalence ratios for Pap testing for  each survey (Table 4, raw counts are in Supplemental Table 2).  BRFSS reported the greatest  number of significant predictors of cervical cancer screening.  Women 60-64 years old were  12% less likely to report screening than the 45-49-year-olds (aPR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85-0.91).   Likewise, women living in rural areas were 5% less likely to screen than urban dwellers (aPR  0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98). Women with more than a high school education were 20% more likely  to screen than women with less than a high school education (aPR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.13-1.28).   Compared to NHW women, NHB women were equally likely to screen, but women of other NH  races were 10% less likely to report screening (aPR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83-0.98), and Hispanic  women were 11% more likely to report screening (aPR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.17).  Insured  women were 47% more likely to report screening than uninsured (aPR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.33-1.62)     HINTS only provided trends, not any significant predictors, of cervical cancer screening.   Likewise, HCPS, representing the most vulnerable US population, mirrored the BRFSS trends,  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 14    but without significance, for women of older age, uninsured and in rural locations having less  likelihood of screening. Contrary to BRFSS, though, HCPS showed that NHB were 35% more  likely (95% CI: 9-68%), Hispanic 48% more likely (95% CI: 25-76%) and women of other NH races  47% more likely (95% CI: 16-86%) compared to NHW women to be screened.   Discussion  Our work is the first to describe and contrast responses from three large US national  health surveys about self-reported cervical cancer screening rates in women 45-65 years old;  and, the first to report the predictors of screening across these three national surveys.  This  work also includes the first analysis of HCPS data for cervical cancer screening.  Most  importantly, regardless of which US health survey we analyzed, we have shown that as women  age, they are less likely to participate in screening. This is of concern for several reasons.  Older  women now comprise nearly half of the women diagnosed with cervical cancer in the US [30].  In addition, there is greater benefit in decreasing the incidence of cervical cancer when women  45-65 years old, compared to younger women, participate in screening [7]. While screening will  benefit an individual woman, a population-based screening rate of 70% is the minimum  screening threshold required to reduce the national cervical cancer incidence [3, 4].  Our work  shows that the most vulnerable populations, as reported by HCPS data, are reporting screening  at or below the 70% minimal threshold.    The national health surveys are sufficiently different from each other in population  composition and sampling frame that differences in predictors of cervical cancer screening by  survey were expected.  Where we see significant predictors of cervical cancer screening in  BRFSS, the relationships are only trends in HCPS and HINTS.  All three surveys, though, were  consistent in the direction and magnitude of older age, rural location, no insurance and less  education predicting less screening.    The most noticeable difference in survey prediction of cervical cancer screening was for  HCPS, though. Despite being the survey reporting the lowest overall cervical cancer screening  rate (66%), the Hispanic, NHB and other NH ethnicities self-reported over 90% screening rates  when screening occurred at the Health Center, nearly approaching the HP2020 goal.  Compared  to NHW women, these women self-reported a significantly greater 35-48% likelihood of  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 15    screening.  While this seems very encouraging that targeted programs successfully reach  underserved women, validation studies show that the actual rates of screening are between a  quarter to a third less than self-reported in community health centers and county hospitals [31- 34].  Reasons for over-reporting include behaviors that favor social desirability, and  acquiescence with expected behaviors, especially among NHB and Hispanic women [35, 36].  All  surveys, though, have an element of over-reporting, even among a managed care population  [37], suggesting that trends among surveys are more important than the magnitude of the  predictors found.    The sampling frames of the surveys contributed to the population differences of the  women participating in the survey.  The sampling frame for BRFSS includes a telephone  interview that results in a near 45% response rate in each of the 50 states and District of  Columbia.  Nonetheless, this response rate resulted in at least tenfold greater absolute  magnitude than is produced by the other sampling frames.  This large sample size allows very  small differences to be statistically significant, whereas, other surveys can only show predictive  trends.  The sampling frame for HINTS had a 25-33% survey response rate, despite providing a  $2 incentive in the mailed interview; and yet, HINTS showed the highest self-reported cervical  cancer screening rate of all surveys.  We expect this as HINTS reflects the primarily employed  and privately insured whose health plans directly incentivize providers to prioritize cervical  cancer screening [38]. Insurance effectively removes economic barriers to accessing screening,  especially when combined with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which required all health plans,  including Section 330 funding, to cover cervical cancer screening with no co-pays for the  woman when screening was performed by a network provider [39]. Even though the ACA  removed out of pocket copays, the screening rates did not increase. In fact, Steenland et al [40]  show continuing downward cervical cancer screening participation despite no insurance co-pay  after the ACA implementation.  Moreover, Watson et al [41, 42] followed cervical cancer  screening rates in the US between 2000 and 2014 (pre-, post-ACA), and also showed  progressively declining screening rates, particularly in older women.  Our analysis updates these  reports and continues to show the downward trend.  Other social determinants of health might  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 16    explain what barriers remain for the remaining 20%-50% who are not participating in screening  [43].    Professional guideline changes in cervical cancer screening techniques and intervals may  have also contributed to the lack of understanding of timely screening.  Similarly, the electronic  medical record ordering systems for cervical cancer screening have also provided multiple  techniques and intervals from which to choose leading to order confusion. These changes  started in 2003 with the approval of HPV testing in combination with cytology (co-testing) to  screen women 30 and older, in addition to the option of cytology alone [44].  In 2004 [45] the  guidelines changed from annually to every two years with liquid based Pap tests starting no  later than 21 years or three years after the woman begins having vaginal intercourse.  At 30  years, if the woman has had three normal consecutive tests, screening may extend to every 2-3  years using liquid Pap tests or every 3 years with HPV-cytology co-testing.  By 2012, guidelines  evolved to every 3 years with cytology for 21-29-year olds and a preferred recommendation of  every 5-year co-testing for women 30-65 years [46]. By 2018 co-testing was no longer favored  [47], and now the USPSTF recommends primary HPV testing every five years [5].  The many  changes in techniques and intervals could have led to misunderstandings on what screening  was recommended and what screening was implemented.     Study limitations and strengths.  As we have discussed above, the limitations and  consequences therefrom include different years of survey implementation, responses that are  self-reported, different sampling frames, different survey sample sizes and changing  professional guidelines.  Despite these limitations, the trends and impact of predictors are still  evaluable, and valuable to future strategies for cervical cancer elimination. Strengths include  the description of the results from three large-scale national surveys routinely used to guide US  health policy, including the first analysis of cervical cancer screening data from HCPS, a Section  330 funding program serving the vulnerable population.  Conclusions:  The three nationally representative large-scale surveys reinforce that current cervical  cancer screening for women 45-65 years old is near or below the 70% minimum threshold  needed to reduce cervical cancer incidence across the population.  While having insurance is  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 17    the strongest predictor of screening participation, and US health care law now requires no  copay for cervical cancer screening, the screening rate of women 45-65 years remains low.   Specifically, older age, not having insurance, not finishing high school, and living in a rural area  are indicators of less cervical cancer screening.

                  <ce:simple-para id="sp0105" view="all">Overall, Pap screening rates were 71% (BRFSS), 79% (HINTS) and 66% (HCPS), among 41,657, 740 and 1571 women, respectively. BRFSS showed that women 60–64 years old (aPR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.91), and in rural locations (aPR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.98) were significantly less likely to report cervical cancer screening than women 45–49-years old or in urban locations. Compared to less than high school, women with more education reported more screening (aPR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.28), and those with insurance had higher screening rates than the uninsured (aPR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.62).
