First, we looked for substantial differences between the calls by using the two algorithms employed by Affymetrix, namely DM and BRLMM. Although some discrepancies were noted, we did not see a material improvement in the data by eliminating this small set of loci. Next, because we had the Affymetrix “cel” files for the PopGen control sample, we called all of these genotypes for PopGen and T1D together by using both the DM and BRLMM algorithms. Again, this process eliminated some problematic loci, but the results were not compelling. Finally, we tried the new Bayesian calling algorithm, CHIAMO.Allele frequencies for the subpopulations were generated with the “Balding-Nichols” modelFour loci did not pass stage 1 criteria.

Cervical cancer screening is an effective preventive measure with a consistent  question format among surveys.  The aim of this study is to describe the predictors of cervical  cancer screening in older women as reported by three national surveys.  Methods: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS 2016)), the Health Information  National Trends Survey (HINTS 2017)), and the Health Center Patient Survey (HCPS 2014)) were  analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses.  We defined the cohort as women, without  hysterectomy, who were 45-65 years old.  The primary outcome was cytology within the last 3  years.  Results:  Overall, Pap screening rates were 71% (BRFSS), 79% (HINTS) and 66% (HCPS), among  41,657, 740 and 1571 women, respectively. BRFSS showed that women 60-64 years old  (aPR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.85,0.91), and in rural locations (aPR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.98) were  significantly less likely to report cervical cancer screening than women 45-49-years old or in  urban locations.  Compared to less than high school, women with more education reported  more screening (aPR=1.20, 95% CI:1.13, 1.28), and those with insurance had higher screening  rates than the uninsured (aPR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.62).  HINTS and HCPS also showed these  trends.    Conclusions:  All three surveys show that cervical cancer screening rates in women 45-65 years  are insufficient to reduce cervical cancer incidence.  Insurance is the major positive predictor of  screening, followed by younger age and more education. Race/ethnicity are variable predictors  depending on the survey.

Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 7    Introduction  National health goals for the United States (US) were established in 1979 through the  Healthy People initiative [1].  Currently, the Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) goals are to  decrease cervical cancer incidence to 7.3/100,000 women [2]. In order to do this, a minimum  70% population participation level in cervical cancer screening is needed [3, 4].  The HP2020  goal is a 93% cervical cancer screening rate among women without hysterectomies [2] with  screening technique and interval informed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force  (USPSTF) guidelines [5].    The age at which cervical cancer screening occurs has a significant impact on the  likelihood of developing invasive cervical cancer [6]. Younger women have significantly less  impact on cancer incidence than do women screened at 45 years or older regardless of the  screening interval or the testing technique [7- 9].  Screening under 30 years of age is considered  the most expensive and least effective [10- 12].  Screening of women over 42 years provides up  to an 80% protective effect [6, 9] against cervical cancer detection at the next screen.  Hence,  we focus our work on the self-reported screening rates of 45-65 years old women in the United  States.    The large scale self-reported health surveys query the health of the US population at  measured intervals to evaluate policy goals and to set future targets.  Hamilton et al [13] led an  effort to harmonize cancer screening questions, using similar constructs (question stems) but  allowing correlate domains to be adaptable to each surveyâ€™s population and purpose.  Over  time, the cancer screening c nstructs around cervical cancer screening have converged to the  same language and offered appropriate evidence-based options for a response around Pap  testing, minimizing response variation due to construct variation [14].    Predictors of screening identified from other surveys include age, geolocation, insurance  status, education and race [15-18].  The significance of the predictors varies depending both on  the survey and the cycle of the survey.  For instance, historically, the association of education  and cervical cancer screening has varied.  The 2013 Health Information National Trends Survey  (HINTS) indicated education was not a predictor of cervical cancer screening uptake [16];  neither did the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) [17].  But, the earlier  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 8    2012 BRFSS data [19] showed that increased education was associated with greater likelihood  of screening. Compared to â€˜high school or lessâ€™, some college was associated with a 38% higher  likelihood of screening and a college graduate was 2.23 times as likely to be screened.  While  the constructs of how cervical cancer screening questions have been harmonized, the variation  in response rates is still substantial among surveys.  Discordant results may lead to confusion in  policy recommendations leaving certain populations at risk and others over-screened.  The  Health Center Patient Survey (HCPS) focuses particularly on low income health recipients who  represent many of the characteristics seen among women under-screened for cervical cancer.   This unique database has recently been released for public analysis.    The primary aim of this study is to explore the recent self-reported cervical cancer  screening rates of older women, 45-65 years, in two representative US databases (BRFSS,  HINTS) and one new database (HCPS) to describe if the predictors of cervical cancer screening  within the vulnerable HCPS population differ from those derived from the BRFSS or HINTS  populations.   Methods  National health surveys.  BRFSS [20] is a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-developed health- related telephone survey that is designed to collect disease prevalence and state-level risk  factor data on adults in all 50 states and District of Columbia in order to establish health related  policies and priorities at the local level.  Individual state health departments conduct landline  and cell phone interviews with representative citizens to gather self-reported health risk  behaviors, the receipt of clinical preventive services and access to health care. Weighting of the  raw data is based on the number of phones in each household such that the BRFSS population  is representative of gender, age, race, education, marital status, and home ownership, in state  and sub-state regions.  The most recent BRFSS dataset, including the health care access  module, available for our analysis is 2016.    HINTS was created by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and  Population Sciences (DCCPS) to monitor changes in the field of cancer-related health  communications [21]. It has been used to understand how adults use different communication  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 9    channels to access information about cancer risk factors, screening, and care in the US.   Questionnaires are mailed to home addresses including high density housing (e.g. public  housing) which are oversampled by design.  The questionnaire includes a $2 pre-paid incentive;  reminder postcards are mailed up to three times.  Weighting, calibration and adjustments are  applied such that HINTS is representative of the US population by age, gender, education,  marital status, race, ethnicity and census region.  Each HINTS is administered in four cycles over  four years; we used HINTS 5 cycle 1 (2017).    The Health Resources and Services Administrationâ€™s (HRSA) Bureau of Primary Health  Care (BPHC) is responsible for the oversight of the Health Center Programs under Section 330 of  the Public Health Services Act [22].  Vulnerable populations cared for by Section 330 funding  health care are 15% of the uninsured, 15% of Medicaid recipients and 7% of the entire US  population [23]. The HCPS is gathered every five years from an in-person, one-on-one interview  with people who are nationally representative of the Health Center Program patient  population.  The data are used to improve health center performance/quality improvement and  operational efficiencies; and to identify health conditions, behaviors, and trends of vulnerable  populations over time by comparison to the US population as a whole. In addition, the HCPS  queries patientsâ€™ access to and satisfaction with health care. The 2014 dataset is the first and  most recent HCPS released to the public and was used in our work. The sampling frames of  each survey are presented in Figure 1 and the constructs of the surveys are in Supplemental  Table 1.    Demographics and predictors of screening.  In our study we included women aged 45- 65 years with no known history of uterine or cervical cancer, and who had not had a  hysterectomy.  Unlike BRFSS and HINTS, HCPS did not ask for specific cancer history so all  women in the specified age range were included. All surveys used a common categorization of  race and ethnicity: Hispanic, non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black (NHB), and other  women of non-Hispanic (NH) ethnicity. Across all three surveys, educational status was  categorized as less than high school, high school graduate, more than high school. Geographical  identification was described differently across all three surveys.  For BRFSS data we combined  center of city metropolitan statistical area (MSA), same county as MSA center city and suburban  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 10    county of MSA into â€œurbanâ€� and not in an MSA as â€œruralâ€� as has been described by the National  Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification Scheme [24, 25].  For HINTS data we  combined large metro, large fringe metro and medium metro into â€œurbanâ€� and small metro,  micropolitan and non-metro into â€œruralâ€� using the same classification scheme [25].  For HCPS  data, urban and rural were the only categories defined.  Insurance status (insured vs.  uninsured) was used in the majority of analysis for all three surveys.  BRFSS collected  information on whether or not respondents had some form of health plan but did not identify  the source; HINTS and HCPS further categorized insurance source by employer/private, publicly  funded, or uninsured.  Employer/private and publicly funded were combined to create an  â€˜insuredâ€™ category when necessary.    Cervical cancer screening.  The primary technique for cervical cancer screening in this  study was cytology.  All three surveys queried about cytology screening: did the woman ever  have a Pap; and when did the last Pap occur.  A secondary indicator for cervical cancer  screening was human papillomavirus (HPV) testing.  Only BRFSS and HCPS queried about HPV  screening: did the woman have an HPV test; and when was the last HPV test.     Statistics.  Within each dataset, predictors of screening were summarized using  proportions, unweighted and weighted with a 95% confidence interval.  Cervical cancer  screening rates were calculated by determining whether individuals had received a Pap test  within the last 3 years.  For BRFSS, we summarized reported HPV screening rates within the last  5 years as a secondary guideline directed screening method.  Pap test and HPV screening rates  were compared in the BRFSS data using McNemarâ€™s test.  We performed pairwise comparisons  of screening rates using post-hoc marginal probability estimates obtained from logistic  regression models for each predictor.  Adjustments were made to p-values using the Bonferroni  correction to account for multiple testing.  Interaction terms between age with race, education  and geolocation were tested with no significant findings, thus non-age stratified rates are  presented. Prevalence ratios comparing 5-year HPV screening rates between different groups  were estimated using binomial regression models with a log link.  Adjusted prevalence ratios for  Pap testing were estimated using Poisson models.  Covariates included age, race, insurance  status, geolocation and education. All datasets were analyzed using weighted sampling  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 11    methods to ensure valid inferences from the responding sample to the population, correcting  for non-response and non-coverage biases [26]. Weighting methods were specific to each  survey [27-29].  Results   Age groups were categorized by five-year intervals for BRFSS and HINTS with intervals of  interest starting at 45-49 years old; HCPS uses 10-year intervals (Table 1). All three surveys  reported similarly aging cohorts; but HINTS and HCPS reported lower enrollment of those over  55 years.  Rural and urban distributions were represented differently.  BRFSS respondents were  more urban than rural (35% vs 7%), but the majority failed to report any location (58%).  HINTS  was more urban than rural (79% vs. 21%) and HCPS was predominantly rural (60%).  While the  HCPS population was more equally distributed across levels of educational attainment, both the  BRFSS and HINTS populations had â€œmore than a high schoolâ€� education compared to â€œless than  a high schoolâ€� education (62% vs 13% and 70% vs 7%, respectively).  Racial and ethnic  representation was similar across all surveys, with the majority being NHW.  Both HINTS (26%)  and HCPS (30%) have a higher combined proportion of NHB and Hispanic respondents than  BRFSS (19%).  Insurance coverage varied across surveys as well; 90% of BRFSS respondents  reported some form of insurance without identifying private vs public sources. HINTS reported  more employer/private insurance than public or uninsured (67% vs 32%) and HCPS reported  more Medicaid/Medicare and uninsured populations than private (88% vs 12%).     Table 2 shows cervical cancer screening rates among women without a hysterectomy.   All survey constructs used the â€œwithin the last 3 yearsâ€� for current Pap testing, which  corresponds to guidelines for cytology screening alone in women 21-65 years [5].  Survey  constructs for HPV testing were aligned with current guidelines for BRFSS, with the option of  â€œwithin last 5 yearsâ€� for women older than 30 years.    Overall estimates of screening rates within the past 3 years were 71% (BRFSS), 79%  (HINTS) and 66% (HCPS).  Among those women who participated in Pap testing but at a longer  interval than guideline directed, HCPS reported twice the rate of longer interval participation  than did HINTS or BRFSS (30% vs. 15%/16%, respectively).  In BRFSS, HPV testing within the last  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 12    5 years significantly lagged Pap testing within the last 3 years by 49% (22% vs 71%, 95% CI of  the difference: 48.2-49.8).     Univariate analyses.  Figure 2 stratifies Pap screening within the last 3 years by five  groups:  age (A), geolocation (B), insurance (C) and educational attainment (D) and  race/ethnicity (E).  As age increases, Pap screening rates decreased across all three surveys.  Only the BRFSS data showed consistent and statistically significant decreases by age group from  75% for the youngest group to 68% for the oldest.  While HINTS showed point estimates of  screening rates above the 70% threshold and HCPS point estimates were at or below this 70%  threshold, both showed trends for decreased screening as age increases.    The three surveys similarly reported differences in screening rates by geolocation.  Urban respondents, regardless of survey, had rates higher than the 70% threshold.  Rural  respondents from HCPS reported the lowest screening rate or the surveys at 61%.    All three surveys showed that screening rates tended to be higher among insured  woman compared to the uninsured women, with BRFSS reporting the largest disparity (74% vs  52%, 95% CI of difference: 18.6-24.4) closely followed by the HCPS rates (71% insured vs 57%  uninsured, 95% CI of difference: 1.7-26.9).  While the overall screening rates differed between  HINTS (~80%) and HCPS (~70%), within each survey, similar screening rates were found for  public and privately insured women.   Increasing educational attainment led to significantly higher screening rates reported in  BRFSS (62% [less than high school] vs. 66% [high school graduation] vs. 76% [more than high  school], overall p <0.001).  In HINTS, while the screening rates similarly trended upward, from  55% to 83%, for higher educational attainment, the trend was not significant.  The HCPS data,  on the other hand, showed relatively uniform screening rates by educational attainment  predominantly at or under the 70% threshold.     Pap screening rates were most strikingly different across surveys by race/ethnicity. In  BRFSS, NHW, NHB and Hispanic women reported screening at very similar rates, around 70%;  while the women of other NH ethnicities reported significantly lower screening rates (72%  (NHW) vs. 65% (women of other NH ethnicities), 95% CI of difference: 2.5-13.0).  In HINTS, all  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 13    racial/ethnic groups reported very similar rates above the 70% threshold, but far from the 93%  HP2020 goal.    By contrast, HCPS data showed that NHW women reported significantly lower screening  rates than each of the race/ethnicity categories by pairwise comparisons. All women who  receive health care from Section 330 Public Health funding have the option to go elsewhere for  Pap screening.  Among the subset who reported having received a recent Pap screening and  having it performed at a Health Center, 82% were within the 3-year guideline; whereas, if the  Pap screening was done elsewhere, 54% were within the 3-year guideline (95% CI of  difference:15.6-42.0).  Of those screened at the HCPS health center within the past 3 years, the  screening rate for Hispanic women was 92% (95% CI: 83-97), for NHB women 93% (95% CI: 86- 97) and for women of other NH races 95% (95% CI: (86-98).    Within BRFSS, of the 22% who reported HPV testing within the last 5 years, the adjusted  prevalence rates in Table 3 showed similar trends to Pap screening: lower rates were more  likely among older women, women living in rural areas, women with less education and  uninsured women.  HPV testing among women of different races/ethnicities differed from Pap  testing with NHB and Hispanic women have a higher likelihood of screening than NHW women.     Multivariate modeling. We calculated the adjusted prevalence ratios for Pap testing for  each survey (Table 4, raw counts are in Supplemental Table 2).  BRFSS reported the greatest  number of significant predictors of cervical cancer screening.  Women 60-64 years old were  12% less likely to report screening than the 45-49-year-olds (aPR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85-0.91).   Likewise, women living in rural areas were 5% less likely to screen than urban dwellers (aPR  0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98). Women with more than a high school education were 20% more likely  to screen than women with less than a high school education (aPR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.13-1.28).   Compared to NHW women, NHB women were equally likely to screen, but women of other NH  races were 10% less likely to report screening (aPR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83-0.98), and Hispanic  women were 11% more likely to report screening (aPR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.17).  Insured  women were 47% more likely to report screening than uninsured (aPR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.33-1.62)     HINTS only provided trends, not any significant predictors, of cervical cancer screening.   Likewise, HCPS, representing the most vulnerable US population, mirrored the BRFSS trends,  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 14    but without significance, for women of older age, uninsured and in rural locations having less  likelihood of screening. Contrary to BRFSS, though, HCPS showed that NHB were 35% more  likely (95% CI: 9-68%), Hispanic 48% more likely (95% CI: 25-76%) and women of other NH races  47% more likely (95% CI: 16-86%) compared to NHW women to be screened.   Discussion  Our work is the first to describe and contrast responses from three large US national  health surveys about self-reported cervical cancer screening rates in women 45-65 years old;  and, the first to report the predictors of screening across these three national surveys.  This  work also includes the first analysis of HCPS data for cervical cancer screening.  Most  importantly, regardless of which US health survey we analyzed, we have shown that as women  age, they are less likely to participate in screening. This is of concern for several reasons.  Older  women now comprise nearly half of the women diagnosed with cervical cancer in the US [30].  In addition, there is greater benefit in decreasing the incidence of cervical cancer when women  45-65 years old, compared to younger women, participate in screening [7]. While screening will  benefit an individual woman, a population-based screening rate of 70% is the minimum  screening threshold required to reduce the national cervical cancer incidence [3, 4].  Our work  shows that the most vulnerable populations, as reported by HCPS data, are reporting screening  at or below the 70% minimal threshold.    The national health surveys are sufficiently different from each other in population  composition and sampling frame that differences in predictors of cervical cancer screening by  survey were expected.  Where we see significant predictors of cervical cancer screening in  BRFSS, the relationships are only trends in HCPS and HINTS.  All three surveys, though, were  consistent in the direction and magnitude of older age, rural location, no insurance and less  education predicting less screening.    The most noticeable difference in survey prediction of cervical cancer screening was for  HCPS, though. Despite being the survey reporting the lowest overall cervical cancer screening  rate (66%), the Hispanic, NHB and other NH ethnicities self-reported over 90% screening rates  when screening occurred at the Health Center, nearly approaching the HP2020 goal.  Compared  to NHW women, these women self-reported a significantly greater 35-48% likelihood of  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 15    screening.  While this seems very encouraging that targeted programs successfully reach  underserved women, validation studies show that the actual rates of screening are between a  quarter to a third less than self-reported in community health centers and county hospitals [31- 34].  Reasons for over-reporting include behaviors that favor social desirability, and  acquiescence with expected behaviors, especially among NHB and Hispanic women [35, 36].  All  surveys, though, have an element of over-reporting, even among a managed care population  [37], suggesting that trends among surveys are more important than the magnitude of the  predictors found.    The sampling frames of the surveys contributed to the population differences of the  women participating in the survey.  The sampling frame for BRFSS includes a telephone  interview that results in a near 45% response rate in each of the 50 states and District of  Columbia.  Nonetheless, this response rate resulted in at least tenfold greater absolute  magnitude than is produced by the other sampling frames.  This large sample size allows very  small differences to be statistically significant, whereas, other surveys can only show predictive  trends.  The sampling frame for HINTS had a 25-33% survey response rate, despite providing a  $2 incentive in the mailed interview; and yet, HINTS showed the highest self-reported cervical  cancer screening rate of all surveys.  We expect this as HINTS reflects the primarily employed  and privately insured whose health plans directly incentivize providers to prioritize cervical  cancer screening [38]. Insurance effectively removes economic barriers to accessing screening,  especially when combined with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which required all health plans,  including Section 330 funding, to cover cervical cancer screening with no co-pays for the  woman when screening was performed by a network provider [39]. Even though the ACA  removed out of pocket copays, the screening rates did not increase. In fact, Steenland et al [40]  show continuing downward cervical cancer screening participation despite no insurance co-pay  after the ACA implementation.  Moreover, Watson et al [41, 42] followed cervical cancer  screening rates in the US between 2000 and 2014 (pre-, post-ACA), and also showed  progressively declining screening rates, particularly in older women.  Our analysis updates these  reports and continues to show the downward trend.  Other social determinants of health might  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 16    explain what barriers remain for the remaining 20%-50% who are not participating in screening  [43].    Professional guideline changes in cervical cancer screening techniques and intervals may  have also contributed to the lack of understanding of timely screening.  Similarly, the electronic  medical record ordering systems for cervical cancer screening have also provided multiple  techniques and intervals from which to choose leading to order confusion. These changes  started in 2003 with the approval of HPV testing in combination with cytology (co-testing) to  screen women 30 and older, in addition to the option of cytology alone [44].  In 2004 [45] the  guidelines changed from annually to every two years with liquid based Pap tests starting no  later than 21 years or three years after the woman begins having vaginal intercourse.  At 30  years, if the woman has had three normal consecutive tests, screening may extend to every 2-3  years using liquid Pap tests or every 3 years with HPV-cytology co-testing.  By 2012, guidelines  evolved to every 3 years with cytology for 21-29-year olds and a preferred recommendation of  every 5-year co-testing for women 30-65 years [46]. By 2018 co-testing was no longer favored  [47], and now the USPSTF recommends primary HPV testing every five years [5].  The many  changes in techniques and intervals could have led to misunderstandings on what screening  was recommended and what screening was implemented.     Study limitations and strengths.  As we have discussed above, the limitations and  consequences therefrom include different years of survey implementation, responses that are  self-reported, different sampling frames, different survey sample sizes and changing  professional guidelines.  Despite these limitations, the trends and impact of predictors are still  evaluable, and valuable to future strategies for cervical cancer elimination. Strengths include  the description of the results from three large-scale national surveys routinely used to guide US  health policy, including the first analysis of cervical cancer screening data from HCPS, a Section  330 funding program serving the vulnerable population.  Conclusions:  The three nationally representative large-scale surveys reinforce that current cervical  cancer screening for women 45-65 years old is near or below the 70% minimum threshold  needed to reduce cervical cancer incidence across the population.  While having insurance is  Journal Pre-proof Jo urn al  Pr e-p roo f 17    the strongest predictor of screening participation, and US health care law now requires no  copay for cervical cancer screening, the screening rate of women 45-65 years remains low.   Specifically, older age, not having insurance, not finishing high school, and living in a rural area  are indicators of less cervical cancer screening.

The collision systems investigated are Pbâ€“Pb, pâ€“Pb, and pp, and results from studies of bulk particle production, azimuthal correlations, open and hidden heavy ï¬‚avor, and hard probes are shown. The results provide key constraints on transport properties of the QCD matter, the initial conditions, the dynamics of heavy quarks in hot and dense systems, and the coupling of hard probes with the medium. A brief description of the ALICE upgrade program is also given. 1. Introduction ALICE is the only dedicated heavy-ion experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and has an extensive set of sub-detectors which can probe a broad set of observables from heavy-ion and elementary collisions. The ALICE collaboration presented 28 parallel talks and over 60 posters at this Quark Matter conference. The results presented are based on data sampled from LHC running period 1, and the ongoing running period 2. Table 1 shows the corresponding collisions particle species and center of mass energies for those periods. The integrated luminosities obtained in running period 2 were signiï¬�cantly higher than running period 1.

Overview of collisions systems and energies investigated at the LHC. The primary detector of ALICE is the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), which measures charged par- ticles via their ionization trails in the gaseous region. The TPC has an angular acceptance of 0 < Ï• < 2Ï€, |Î·| < 0.9 for tracks with full radial track length, and |Î·| < 1.5 for tracks of reduced length. Information from the Inner Tracking System (ITS) is used to improve the spatial resolution of TPC tracks, which helps with the rejection of secondary tracks and to improve the momentum resolution.

Two VZERO counters, each containing two ar- rays of scintillator tiles and covering 2.8 < Î· < 5.1 (VZERO-A) and âˆ’3.7 < Î· < âˆ’1.7 (VZERO-C), provide information for triggering and event class determination. The Forward Multiplicity Detector (FMD) detects charged particles in the ranges âˆ’3.5 < Î· < âˆ’1.7 and 1.7 < Î· < 5.0, while the Muon Spectrometer covers the range 2.5 < Î· < 4. The Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs), located 115 meters away from the interaction point, measures spectator neutrons from heavy-ion collisions. At mid-rapidity, particle identiï¬�cation can be carried out using the TPC and ITS, as well as the Time of Flight (TOF) detector and the High Momentum Particle Identiï¬�cation Detector (HMPID). The Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) is used for electron identiï¬�cation. The Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) is primarily used to detect high momentum neu- tral particles at mid-rapidity. A more detailed description of the ALICE detector can be found elsewhere [1]. In Fig. 1, we show an ALICE event display from a Pbâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 5.02 TeV 0 âˆ’ 5% collision. Using the extensive Î· range provided by the various subdetectors, we are able to determine that 21400Â± 1300 charged particles are produced over full phase space in such collisions [2, 3]. 2. Bulk Particle Production The light ï¬‚avor particles comprise of the majority of the particles produced, and as mentioned, the AL- ICE detector has extensive capabilities regarding particle identiï¬�cation. In Fig. 2, we show inclusive Ï€ and p spectra from Pbâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 5.02 TeV collisions [4]. All four of our charged hadron PID detectors (TPC, ITS, TOF, HMPID) were used. The increasing radial ï¬‚ow with increasing centrality is particularly evident in the p spectra, where the peak shifts to progressively larger values. A Blast Wave ï¬�t was performed on the Ï€, K, and p spectra simultaneously [5], and the obtained radial ï¬‚ow velocities are the highest ever observed from heavy-ion collisions (ã€ˆÎ²T ã€‰ âˆ¼ 0.66). First measurements of event-by-event net particle moments were also presented [6]. Ratios of diï¬€erent order moments can be directly compared to Lattice QCD calculations, and provide information of the system such as the chemical freeze out temperature. In particular, the second order net proton moments were shown, and it was found these moments are consistent with the expecta- tions from a Skellam distribution, with small corrections for baryon number conservation. The Skellam distribution assumes the distributions of single (anti) protons are Poissonian and independent. A.

Measurements of Ï€0 and Î· spectra in ppâˆš s = 2.76 TeV collisions with unprecedented pT coverage were also shown, and pQCD inspired models were found to describe the spectra over many orders of magnitude [8, 9]. 3. Azimuthal Correlations Measurements of global hyperon polarization with respect to the reaction plane are sensitive to both the vorticity and magnetic ï¬�eld created in heavy-ion collisions. The results from RHIC show decreasing Î› and Î›Â¯ polarization values with energy [10], and our results are shown in the left panel of Fig. 4. They are consistent with extremely small values (less than 0.1%) at the LHC. The Chiral Magnetic Eï¬€ect (CME) is also driven by the presence of a magnetic ï¬�eld, and the corresponding charge separation along the magnetic ï¬�eld direction may be indicative of parity violation in the strong interaction. The charge separation can be characterized by the Î³ correlator [12], which is the diï¬€erence of the three-particle correlator ã€ˆcos(Ï•a + Ï•b + 2Î¨2)ã€‰ for opposite and same sign pairs. However, there have been recent indications that a combination of elliptic ï¬‚ow and charge conservation contribute to this correlator as background [13]. In order to disentangle signal and background, we have employed the Event Shape Engineering technique [14], which can be used to vary the eccentricity (therefore the elliptic ï¬‚ow) for a given centrality. Using initial state model calculations to determine the variation of the magnetic ï¬�eld, we are able to determine the fraction of the CME signal contributing to the the Î³ correlator. That fraction is shown in the right panel of Fig. 4. Integrating over a wide centrality range (10-50%), we ï¬�nd that the fraction has a 1Ïƒ upper limit of âˆ¼ 20%.

Right Panel: Estimate of fraction of CME signal using ESE from Pbâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 2.76 TeV collisions [12]. In Fig. 5, we show our identiï¬�ed particle v2 from Pbâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 5.02 TeV collisions [15]. These mea- surements were compared to predictions from the hydrodynamic models, and are sensitive to the hadroniza- tion mechanism and radial ï¬‚ow. Compared to previous ALICE results at lower energy [16], the increased precision of Ï† measurement shows a clear grouping with the protons at low pT (similar mass), and the mesons at mid pT (same quark number). It was found that v2 for diï¬€erent species becomes similar at high pT (pT   10 GeV/c). Given that anisotropies in this region are believed to be driven by the diï¬€erences in in- plane and out-plane jet quenching, these results show such quenching is ï¬‚avor independent. This hypothesis is conï¬�rmed by the similar behaviour of the light hadron RAA, which also converges at high pT for diï¬€erent particle species [7]. Studies which attempt to decompose higher order azimuthal ï¬‚ow vectors in terms of contributions from lower order vectors were also shown [17]. The extracted measurement is Ï‡mn, and when A.

The non- linear coeï¬ƒcients Ï‡mn were found to have diï¬€erent sensitivities to the initial anisotropy and the viscosity of the medium, and can be used to disentangle the two eï¬€ects. 4. Open and Hidden Heavy Flavor The transport parameters that govern heavy quark interactions with the medium in heavy-ion collisions can be calculated by various approaches e.g. perturbative QCD, eï¬€ective potential models from lattice QCD, and AdS/CFT. The generation of heavy quark v2 is sensitive to these transport parameters, and we show measurements of J/Î¨ v2 (event plane method) from Pbâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 5.02 TeV collisions in Fig. 6. These are the ï¬�rst measurements that show deï¬�nitively that the charm quark ï¬‚ows at the LHC. Comparisons to the open heavy-ï¬‚avor D mesons are also shown for the same energy. There are diï¬€erences at low pT, presumably related to the diï¬€erences in light and heavy quark ï¬‚ow. Such comparisons should help constrain the hadronization mechanisms of the charm quark. In the left panel of Fig. 7, we show D meson nuclear modiï¬�cation factor RAA as a function of pT from Pbâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 5.02 TeV collisions [18]. A suppression is observed over the whole pT range, which is qualitatively reproduced by the various model calculations. However, there is clearly an ambiguity regarding the model calculations, which can be potentially resolved by comparing other measurements (e.g. v2) with the same models. Heavy Flavor Decay Muon RAA as a function of pT were shown [20], and we found little (if any) energy dependence when comparing Pbâ€“Pb collisions with âˆš sNN = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV up to pT âˆ¼ 20 GeV/c. Moving back to hidden heavy-ï¬‚avor, measurements of integrated J/Î¨ RAA were shown for both the J/Î¨ â†’ e+ + eâˆ’ and J/Î¨ â†’ Î¼+ + Î¼âˆ’ channels from Pbâ€“Pb âˆšsNN = 5.02 TeV collisions [19, 21]. Transport models including both in-medium dissociation and recombination eï¬€ects were able to reproduce the observed suppressions reasonably well. In the right panel of Fig. 7 we show J/Î¨ RAA as a function of rapidity (ycms) from pâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 8 TeV collisions [19], which help constrain the initial state and cold nuclear matter eï¬€ects relevant for the A. Timmins / Nuclear Physics A 967 (2017) 43â€“50 47 ALI-PREL-119009 Fig. 6. Open and hidden heavy ï¬‚avor v2 from Pbâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 5.02 TeV collisions [18, 19] heavy-ion measurements. A suppression is observed in the p going direction, while RAA is consistent with 1 in the Pb going direction. The various models (shadowing, energy loss, CGC) appear to describe the ycms dependence. For the p going direction, RAA as a function of pT was found to be most suppressed at low pT and consistent with 1 at pT > 6 GeV/c. The same models explored in the right panel of Fig. 7 were found to describe the pT dependence. Regarding J/Î¨ production in pp âˆš s = 13 TeV collisions, the yields were shown to scale approximately linearly with the charge hadron multiplicity [22]. This dependence was described rather well with phenomenological models including Multiple Parton Interactions. Our ï¬�rst di- electron continuum results from pp âˆš s = 13 TeV collisions where also shown, and we found no change in shape comparing low to high multiplicity collisions [23]. 5. Hard Probes The jet mass is sensitive to the initial virtuality of the parton at the origin of the shower, and may tem- porarily increase in a hot QCD medium, leading to a larger gluon radiation probability [25]. It is deï¬�ned as the diï¬€erence between the energy of the jet (Ejet) and its transverse (pT,jet) and longitudinal (pz,jet) momen- tum: Mjet = âˆš E2jet âˆ’ p2T,jet âˆ’ pz,jet2 (2) Our ï¬�rst measurements of the average jet mass for reconstructed charged hadron jets in Pbâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 2.76 TeV collisions are shown in the left panel of Fig. 8, where the average mass increases with jet pT [24]. Models with quenching (JEWEL+PYTHIA recoil on and Q-PYTHIA) indeed predict larger values compare to the vacuum model (PYTHIA Perugia 2011 tunes), however, somewhat surprisingly, the vacuum model is closer to the data. The pâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 5.02 TeV measurements were also consistent with Pb-Pb, perhaps indicating that much of the extra gluon radiation is outside of the jet cone. Our ï¬�rst measurements of N-subjettiness (Ï„2/Ï„1) in Pbâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 2.76 TeV collisions were also presented [27]. The ratio of Ï„2/Ï„1 extracted from jets and is inversely related to the probability of the leading parton splitting into two resolvable partons. The presence of a hot medium shifts Ï„2/Ï„1 to higher values. However, as with our jet mass measurements, the data from heavy-ion collisions were consistent with vacuum expectations from the PYTHIA model. The eï¬€ects of jet quenching were more readily seen in the associated yield ratio of IAA from two-particle correlations using Ï€0 particles as the trigger [8, 26]. For the associated charged hadron yields at low pT, an enhancement was seen on the near-side, which was even greater with respect to the A.

In order to investigate possible jet quenching in light systems, measurements of the recoil jet yield were carried out, which extract the number of away-side reconstructed jets per hadron trigger [28]. While the away-side jet yields are suppressed in central Pbâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 2.76 TeV collisions relative to peripheral, the right panel of Fig. 8 shows no such suppression in high multiplicity pâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 5.02 TeV collisions. We also presented near-side peak widths of two-particle correlations from pp âˆš s = 13 TeV collisions as a function of multiplicity [29]. Unlike the case Pbâ€“Pb âˆš sNN = 2.76 TeV collisions [30], the widths were found to be constant, and well reproduced by the PYTHIA model. 6. Upgrades ALICE is undergoing an extensive upgrade program, and there were two parallel presentations reviewing two of the projects within that program. The ï¬�rst presentation detailed the TPC upgrade [31], which will be the ï¬�rst application of GEM technology in a large scale TPC readout. In continuous readout mode, the TPC will be able to record events at rates 50 times larger than its current ability. The second presentation discussed the ITS upgrade [32]. This will involve the largest application of Si pixel sensors in a single detector, with improved data recording rates and hit precision. Both upgrades will be complete by running period 3, which is expected to start in the early 2020s. 7. Summary Using the high precision data from running period 2, we have observed the largest ever radial ï¬‚ow velocities from heavy-ion collisions. At higher pT , we observed that light ï¬‚avor v2 for diï¬€erent species becomes similar at high pT (pT   10 GeV/c). A similar pattern is seen for RAA, and indicates ï¬‚avor independent quenching controls these observables. We have shown the ï¬�rst direct evidence of charm quark elliptic ï¬‚ow at the LHC, and coupled with our RAA measurements, these place stronger constraints on heavy quark medium interactions. Using data from running period 1, we have shown the ï¬�rst net particle moments at the LHC. We have also placed strong constraints on background contributions to the CME signal, and shown a new set of jet observables which can probe aspects of interactions between fast partons in the hot and dense medium.

            The 27th International Conference on Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions: Quark Matter 2018The 27th International Conference on Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions: Quark Matter 2018XXVIIth International Conference on Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions (Quark Matter 2018) Highlights from the ATLAS experiment Iwona Grabowska-Bold on behalf of the ATLAS Collaborationa, aAGH University of Science and Technology, KrakoÂ´w, Poland Abstract This report provides an overview of the new results obtained by the ATLAS Collaboration at the LHC, which were presented at the Quark Matter 2018 conference. These measurements were covered in 12 parallel talks, one ï¬‚ash talk and 11 posters. In this document, a discussion of results is grouped into four areas: electromagnetic interactions, jet quenching, quarkonia and heavy-ï¬‚avour production, and collectivity in small and larger systems. Measurements from the xenon-xenon collisions based on a short run collected in October 2017 are reported for the ï¬�rst time. Keywords: ATLAS experiment, quark-gluon plasma, photon-induced processes, jet quenching, quarkonia production, heavy-ï¬‚avour production, collectivity in small systems, xenon-xenon collisions 1. Introduction In addition to proton-proton (pp) physics, the ATLAS Collaboration [1] participates in the heavy- ion (HI) programme which has been carried out at the LHC since 2010. Lead-lead (Pb+Pb) and proton- lead (p+Pb) collisions were provided at the centre-of-mass energies of 2.76 TeV, 5.02 TeV for Pb+Pb, and 5.02 TeV for p+Pb. In October 2017 a short period with xenon-xenon (Xe+Xe) collisions was taken. This opened up an opportunity of studying impact of diï¬€erent geometries on a broad range of observables. More- over, the HI programme is supplemented with measurements in the pp system, which serve as a reference to disentangle initial- from ï¬�nal-state eï¬€ects. 2. Electromagnetic interactions in the QGP The strong electromagnetic ï¬�eld associated with highly boosted nuclei at the LHC can be utilised to study the scattering of the quasi-real photons emitted coherently from the nuclei as they pass by next to each other. These are so-called Ultra-Peripheral Collisions (UPC). In the previous measurements of exlusive production of di-muon pairs [2] and light-by-light scattering [3], ATLAS already demonstrated that photon Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Nuclear Physics A 982 (2019) 8â€“14 0375-9474/Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. www.elsevier.com/locate/nuclphysa https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2018.08.024 This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). ï¬‚uxes emerging from Pb beams are well modelled by the STARlight generator. Also in those measurements, an acoplanarity distribution (Î± = 1 âˆ’ Î”Ï† Ï€ , where Î”Ï† is a distance in azimuth between ï¬�nal-state particles) was measured and proved to be powerful in discriminating between signal and background processes. Very recenty ATLAS has explored a potential of observing events from exclusive production of Î³Î³ â†’ Î¼+Î¼âˆ’ contributing to a sample of inelastic minimum-bias Pb+Pb collisions [4]. After evaluating and re- moving the contribution from background sources, the azimuthal angle (Î”Ï†) and transverse momentum (pT) correlations between the muons are measured as a function of collision centrality. Figure 1 shows the background-subtracted acoplanarity distribution in diï¬€erent centrality intervals. Each distribution is normalised to unity over its measured range. The > 80% distribution with a signiï¬�cant contri- bution from UPC events is plotted in each panel for comparison. A clear, centrality-dependent broadening is seen in the acoplanarity distributions when compared to the > 80% interval. The corresponding distribution from the Î³Î³ â†’ Î¼+Î¼âˆ’ MC samples is also shown. The MC Î± distributions show almost no centrality depen- dence, indicating that the broadening evident in the data is notably larger than that expected from detector eï¬€ects. One potential source of modiï¬�cation is the ï¬�nal-state interaction of the produced leptons with the electric charges in the QGP. Assuming that the broadening of the Î± distribution results from transfers of a small amount of pT to each muon, in the 0â€“10% centrality interval that scale, assumed to be the RMS momentum transfer to each ï¬�nal-state muon in the transverse plane, is evaluated to amount to 70Â± 10 MeV. Fig. 1. Background-subtracted acoplanarity distribution (Î±) in four centrality intervals in Pb+Pb data [4]. A comparison to the STARlight calculation for Î³Î³ â†’ Î¼+Î¼âˆ’ is also shown. The distributions are normalised to unity over their measured range. 3. Jet quenching Using the large statistics of the 2015 Pb+Pb data, ATLAS ï¬�nalised measurements of inclusive jet nuclear modiï¬�cation factor (RAA) [5], as well as jet fragmentation functions [6]. Those results provide very detailed studies of inclusive jet production as a function of jet pT, rapidity (y) and centrality in comparison to the reference pp data collected at 5.02 TeV. The RAA evaluated as a function of jet pT for two centrality intervals 0â€“10% and 30â€“40% is presented in the left panel of Fig. 2. The RAA value is obtained for jets with |y| < 2.1 and with pT between 80â€“1000 GeV. A clear suppression of jet production in central Pb+Pb collisions relative to pp collisions is observed. In the 0-10% centrality interval, RAA is approximately 0.45 at pT = 100 GeV, and is observed to grow slowly (quenching decreases) with increasing jet pT, reaching a value of 0.6 for jets with pT around 800 GeV. In the same ï¬�gure, the RAA values at 5.02 TeV are compared with the previous measurements at âˆš sNN = 2.76 TeV. The two measurements agree within their uncertainties in the overlapping pT region. The apparent reduction of the size of systematic uncertainties in the new measurement is possible thans to large samples of pp and Pb+Pb data collected during the same LHC running period. Further insight in jet quenching can be obtained by studying jet fragmentation functions. The right panel of Fig. 2 presents a ratio of transverse jet fragmentation functions D(pT) in Pb+Pb to those extracted in pp collisions as a function of jet fragment pT for three jet pT intervals. The RD(pT) is above unity (enhancement) for low pT jet fragments, drops below unity for intermediate jet pT fragments (suppression) and becomes larger than unity again for jet fragment pT around 50 GeV. There is no signiï¬�cant diï¬€erence between RD(pT) for three jet pT intervals. A comparison between the data and the hybrid model calculation is also shown. I.

(Right) RD(pT) ratios for three jet pT ranges: 126â€“158 GeV (circles), 200â€“251 GeV (diamonds) and 316â€“398 GeV (crosses) compared with calculations from the hybrid model with Rres = 3 [6]. The model is able to describe the intermediate- and high-pT regions for jet fragments, while it fails in the low-pT region. The ATLAS Collaboration performed a preliminary measurement of the angular distribution of charged particles around the jet axis in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb and pp data [7]. The measured yields are deï¬�ned as: RD(pT) = 1 Njet 1 2Ï€r d2nch(r) drdpT , (1) where Njet is the total number of jets, 2Ï€rdr is the area of the annulus at a given distance r from the jet axis (r = âˆš Î”Î·2 + Î”Ï†2 with Î”Î· and Î”Ï† being the relative diï¬€erences between the charged particle and the jet axis, in pseudorapidity and azimuth respectively), dr is the width of the annulus and nch(r) is the number of charged particles within a given annulus. Results are presented as a function of Pb+Pb collision centrality, and both jet and charged-particle pT in the left panel of Fig. 3. Ratios of D(pT, r) distributions in Pb+Pb to those measured in pp collisions as a function of r for six charged-particle pT intervals spanning values between 1.6â€“63.1 GeV in 0â€“10% centrality, and for jet pT between 200â€“251 GeV are shown. The RD(pT,r) is above unity for all r values for charged particles with pT less than 4 GeV. For these particles, RD(pT,r) grows with increasing r for r < 0.3 and is approximately constant for 0.3 < r < 0.6. For pT > 4.0 GeV, RD(pT,r) is below unity and decreases with increasing r for r < 0.3 and is approximately constant for 0.3 < r < 0.6. The observed behaviour inside the jet (r < 0.4) agrees with the measurement of the inclusive jet fragmentation functions [6], where yields of the low-pT fragments are observed to be enhanced and yields of charged particles with intermediate pT are suppressed. The measured dependence of RD(pT,r) suggests that the energy lost by jets through the jet quenching process is being transferred to particles with pT < 4.0 GeV with larger radial distances. ATLAS also measures inclusive jet mass (m) divided by the jet transverse momentum [8]. This fully- unfolded measurement of the jet structure is sensitive to the angular and momentum correlations of the jet constituents. These correlations can be used to study modiï¬�cations of jets in HI collisions, where they provide complementary information to previously measured jet fragmentation functions. The right panel of Fig. 3 presents RAA as a function of m/pT in 0â€“10% centrality for jet pT between 126â€“158 GeV. For all centrality bins, these values have no signiï¬�cant dependence on m/pT. They are also observed to be consistent with the inclusive jet RAA. A preliminary measurement of the balance between isolated photons and inclusive jets in pT in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb and pp data is performed. Photons with pTÎ³ > 63.1 GeV and |Î·Î³| < 2.37 are paired inclusively with all jets that have pT > 31.6 GeV and |Î·| < 2.8 in the event. The transverse momentum balance given by the jet-to-photon pT ratio, xJÎ³, are measured for pairs with azimuthal opening angle |Î”Ï†| > 7Ï€/8. Distribu- tions of the per-photon jet yield (1/NÎ³)(dN/dxJÎ³) are corrected for detector eï¬€ects via a two-dimensional unfolding procedure and reported at the particle level for the ï¬�rst time. I.

The xJÎ³ distributions in Pb+Pb collisions evolve smoothly with centrality. For peripheral collisions with centrality 50â€“80%, they are similar to those measured in pp collisions. However, in increasingly more central collisions, the distributions become systematically more modiï¬�ed. The xJÎ³ distribution in the most central 0â€“10% events is so strongly modiï¬�ed that it is monotonically decreasing over the measured xJÎ³ range and no peak is observed. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2) Î³Jx /d N )( d Î³ N  (1 / 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 Î³Jx 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2) Î³Jx /d N )( d Î³ N  (1 / 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 Î³Jx 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 Î³Jx 50-80% 30-50% 20-30% 10-20% 0-10%  PreliminaryATLAS -1 5.02 TeV, 25 pbpp -1Pb+Pb, 0.49 nb  = 63.1-79.6 GeVÎ³ T p  (same each panel)pp Pb+Pb Fig. 4.

To probe physics of jet quenching in HI collisions with nuclei lighter than Pb, the transverse momentum asymme- try of dijet pairs and production rates of charged particles are measured by ATLAS with Xe+Xe collisions collected in October 2017 [10]. Figure 5 presents charged-hadron RAA as a function of pT for three centrality and ã€ˆNpartã€‰ in- tervals along with the measurement from the Pb+Pb sys- tem. The RAA is compared between Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb data at 5.02 TeV. Even though they have diï¬€erent cen- tralities, the ã€ˆNpartã€‰ for the same pT intervals are compa- rable. The Xe+Xe data shows more suppression than the Pb+Pb data in more central collisions, and less suppression in more peripheral collisions. I. Grabowska-Bold / Nuclear Physics A 982 (2019) 8â€“14 11 4. Quarkonia and heavy-ï¬‚avour production The ATLAS Collaboration ï¬�nalised a detailed study on prompt and non-prompt J/Ïˆ and Ïˆ(2S ) produc- tion and suppression at high pT in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb and pp collisions [11]. The measurements of per-event yields, nuclear modiï¬�cation factors, and non-prompt fractions are performed in the di-muon decay chan- nel for 9 < pÎ¼Î¼T < 40 GeV in di-muon transverse momentum, and 2.0 < yÎ¼Î¼ < 2.0 in rapidity. Strong suppression is found in Pb+Pb collisions for both prompt and non-prompt J/Ïˆ, as well as for prompt and non-prompt Ïˆ(2S ), increasing with event centrality. The suppression of prompt Ïˆ(2S ) is observed to be stronger than that of J/Ïˆ, while the suppression of non-prompt Ïˆ(2S ) is equal to that of the non-prompt J/Ïˆ within uncertainties, consistent with the expectation that both arise from b-quarks propagating through the medium. Despite prompt and non-prompt J/Ïˆ arising from diï¬€erent mechanisms, the dependence of their nuclear modiï¬�cation factors on centrality is found to be similar. The left panel of Fig. 6 shows a pT-dependence of the nuclear modiï¬�cation factor for prompt J/Ïˆmesons reconstructed via the muon channel at 5.02 TeV in the 0â€“20% centrality bin. The RAA is at the level of 0.25 at pT = 9 GeV and tends to increase slowly with pT. The ATLAS measurement at high pT nicely complements the ALICE results for pT < 12 GeV that are also shown on the same ï¬�gure. Recently the ATLAS Collaboration also evaluated elliptic ï¬‚ow of J/Ïˆ with respect to the event plane in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions and presented preliminary results as a function of transverse momentum, rapidity and centrality [12]. It is observed that prompt and non-prompt J/Ïˆ mesons have non-zero elliptic ï¬‚ow. Prompt J/Ïˆ Î½2 decreases as a function of pT, while non-prompt J/Ïˆ Î½2 is ï¬‚at over the studied kinematical region. There is no dependence on rapidity or centrality observed. The right panel of Fig. 6 shows results for the Î½2 as a function of pT for prompt and non-prompt J/Ïˆ as measured by ATLAS compared with inclusive J/Ïˆ at pT < 12 GeV, as measured by ALICE at 5.02 TeV, and prompt J/Ïˆ at 6.5 < pT < 30 GeV, by CMS at 2.76 TeV. Despite diï¬€erent rapidity selections, the ATLAS data is found to be in reasonable agreement with the ALICE and CMS data in the overlapping pT region. Fig. 6. (Left) Comparison of prompt J/Ïˆ RAA measured in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions by ATLAS with the inclusive J/Ïˆ RAA measured by ALICE [11]. (Right) Î½2 as a function of pT for prompt and non-prompt J/Ïˆ as measured by ATLAS compared with inclusive J/Ïˆ at pT < 12 GeV, as measured by ALICE at 5.02 TeV, and prompt J/Ïˆ at 6.5 < pT < 30 GeV by CMS at 2.76 TeV [12]. The ATLAS Collaboration also ï¬�nalised a measurement of the production of muons from heavy-ï¬‚avour decays in 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb and pp collisions [13]. Results are provided in the muon transverse momentum range 4 < pT < 14 GeV and for ï¬�ve centrality intervals. Backgrounds arising from in-ï¬‚ight pion and kaon decays, hadronic showers, and mis-reconstructed muons are statistically removed using a template-ï¬�tting procedure. The heavy-ï¬‚avor muon diï¬€erential cross-sections and per-event yields are measured in pp and Pb+Pb collisions, respectively. Figure 7 presents the heavy-ï¬‚avour muon RAA as a function of pT. The RAA does not depend on pT within the uncertainties of the measurement. The RAA decreases between peripheral 40â€“60% collisions, where it is about 0.65, to more central collisions, reaching a value of about 0.35 in the 0â€“10% centrality interval. In Ref. [13] the azimuthal modulation of the heavy-ï¬‚avor muon yields is also measured and the I.

Collectivity in small and large systems One active area of ongoing research is investigation of the nature of the long-range ridge observed in two-particle correlations in small collision systems such as pp and p+Pb. To understand the multi-particle nature of the long-range collective phenomenon in those systems, the ATLAS Collaboration performed a measurement of symmetric cumulants scn,m{4} and asymmetric cumulants acn{3} which probe four- and three-particle correlations of two ï¬‚ow harmonics Î½n and Î½m in 13 TeV pp, 5.02 TeV p+Pb, and 2.76 TeV peripheral Pb+Pb collisions [14]. The large non-ï¬‚ow background from dijet production present in the standard cumulant method is suppressed using a method of subevent cumulants. Fig. 8. The ã€ˆNchã€‰ dependence of sc2,3{4} (left), sc2,4{4} (middle) and ac2{3} (right) in 0.5 < pT < 5 GeV obtained for pp collisions (solid circles), p+Pb collisions (open circles) and low-multiplicity Pb+Pb collisions (open squares) [14]. Figure 8 shows a comparison of cumulants for the three collision systems. The three panels present the results for sc2,3{4}, sc2,4{4}, and ac2{3} for charged particles with 0.3 < pT < 3 GeV. These results indicate a negative correlation between Î½2 and Î½3 and a positive correlation between Î½2 and Î½4. Such correlation patterns have previously been observed in large collision systems, but are now conï¬�rmed also in the small collision systems, once non-ï¬‚ow eï¬€ects are adequately removed in the measurements. In the multiplicity range covered by the pp collisions, ã€ˆNchã€‰ < 150, the results for symmetric cumulants sc2,3{4} and sc2,4{4} are comparable among the three systems. In the range ã€ˆNchã€‰ > 150, |sc2,3{4}| and sc2,4{4} are larger in Pb+Pb than in p+Pb collisions. The results for ac2{3} are similar among the three systems at ã€ˆNchã€‰ < 100, but they deviate from each other at higher ã€ˆNchã€‰. The results for pp data are approximately constant or decrease slightly with ã€ˆNchã€‰, while the p+Pb and Pb+Pb data shows signiï¬�cant increases as a function of ã€ˆNchã€‰. The similarity between diï¬€erent collision systems and the weak dependence of these observables on the pT range and ã€ˆNchã€‰, largely free from non-ï¬‚ow eï¬€ects, provide an important input for understanding the space-time dynamics and the properties of the medium created in small collision systems.

The Î½n n=2-5 measured with the SP method in Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions as a function of centrality percentile [15]. The Pb+Pb data points are shifted along the centrality axis, for clarity. Using a data set of Xe+Xe collisions col- lected at 5.44 TeV, ATLAS measured ï¬‚ow har- monics with the scalar method (SP) and cor- relation techniques involving 2, 4 and 6 par- ticles [15]. Centrality and pT-dependence of the Î½n are studied. Figure 9 shows the Î½n har- monics integrated over the 0.5 < pT < 5 GeV range. The values are compared to those ob- tained for Pb+Pb and are shown as a function of centrality. The small diï¬€erences are related to diï¬€erences in the initial-collision geometry and subtle diï¬€erences due to the system size. Detailed studies of scaling of Î½n and cumulants with ã€ˆNpartã€‰ conï¬�rm the main source of Î½2 to be the initial geometry, while geometry ï¬‚uctu- ations to be the origin of diï¬€erences for Î½n with n > 2. ATLAS also measured the modiï¬�ed Pearsonâ€™s correlation coeï¬ƒcient to quantify correlations between ï¬‚ow coeï¬ƒcients and mean pT of charged particles in the event using 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb data [16]. It can be used in further experimental studies to understand the underlying mechanism of QGP dynamics and constrain theoretical models attempting to describe them. 6. Summary The ATLAS Collaboration presented many new results covering Pb+Pb, p+Pb, pp, and also data from the new Xe+Xe system collected for the ï¬�rst time at the LHC. These measurements provide new information on electromagnetic interactions, the jet quenching, quarkonia and heavy-ï¬‚avour suppression, as well as comprehensive results which provide further insight into the collectivity phenomenon of small collision systems.

A large variety of measurements show the potential of LHCb in nuclear collisions. Keywords: Heavy-ion collisions, heavy-ï¬‚avour production, correlation measurements, ultra-peripheral collisions, LHC, collider, ï¬�xed-target 1. Introduction The LHCb experiment is designed for heavy-ï¬‚avour measurements, precision tests of the standard model and searches for physics beyond the standard model. Its forward rapidity acceptance in 2 < Î· < 5, its instrumentation with precision tracking and vertex determination, the charged hadron particle identiï¬�cation, the muon system and calorimetry combined with a ï¬‚exible trigger system featuring a software level trigger with an input rate of about 1 MHz in pp collisions make the experiment a versatile laboratory for studies aiming at a better understanding of strongly interacting matter in the laboratory [1]. The LHCb collaboration is the youngest member of the LHC heavy-ion family participating with a small luminosity in the 2013 pPb run at 5 TeV and in the 2015 PbPb run. Since these pioneering data takings, signiï¬�cantly larger data sets were successfully recorded and are being planned to be taken this year. Table 1 presents already taken and planned collider data and Figure 1 shows the so far available ï¬�xed target data. We summarise in the following results that are for the ï¬�rst time presented at a Quark Matter conference edition. 2. Correlation measurements in pp collisions LHCb proved its capability to perform dihadron correlation measurements of primary charged particles in pPb collisions [2]. While this measurement type is also pursued in pp collisions to probe collectivity [3], LHCb explored for the ï¬�rst time Bose-Einstein correlations of identical pions in pp collisions to constrain the spatio-temporal particle emission patterns as a function of ï¬�nal state particle production multiplicity [4]. The correlation functions are presented in form of a double ratio of C(Q) = C(Q) S E,data 2 /C(Q) ME,data 2 C(Q)S E,MC2 /C(Q) ME,MC 2 with Q being Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Nuclear Physics A 982 (2019) 15â€“21 0375-9474/Â© 2018 The Authors.

The resulting source sizes show a similar dependence as observed at midrapidity by other LHC experiments [5, 6, 7] as a function of ï¬�nal state particle multiplicity. More diï¬€erential studies and studies in pPb collisions are natural extensions of this ï¬�rst result at forward rapidity at the LHC.

Left panel: the D0 nuclear modiï¬�cation factor as a function of rapidity compared with model calculations in the collinear factorisation framework that are tuned to reproduce the pp production cross sections and display the nPDF uncertainties on the left as well as a colour glass condensate calculation. Right hand: the nuclear modiï¬�cation factor at forward rapidity as a function of transverse momentum compared with the same model approaches detailed in Ref. [8]. large transverse momenta of around 10 GeV/c is visible. The data points are contained in the envelope of uncertainties within a model using collinear factorisation and being tuned to reproduce pp collision data and displaying the uncertainties related to nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDF) that are considerably larger than the experimental uncertainties. The forward rapidity data, both integrated and pT -diï¬€erential, are reasonably reproduced by a colour glass calculation in the dilute-dense approximation. At backward rapid- ity, the last bins are indicating values above unity for rapidity diï¬€erential nuclear modiï¬�cation factors. Both observations, large modiï¬�cations as well as the signiï¬�cantly smaller uncertainties than those aï¬€ecting nPDF sets, urge and encourage us to clarify the sources of nuclear modiï¬�cations in pPb collisions. In particular, a clariï¬�cation will be necessary to make full use of precision improvements of heavy-ï¬‚avour observables in nucleus-nucleus collisions to extract parameters for quark matter studies. In addition, the characterisation of the gluonic content of nuclei and nucleons in view of physics of the saturation scale at the highest avail- able collision energy would beneï¬�t from a falsiï¬�cation of available models via the combination of the full available set of data. In pPb collisions at âˆš sNN = 5 TeV, a ï¬�rst measurement of the prompt Î›C at forward and backward rapidity has been undertaken by LHCb1. In Figure 4, the prompt Î›C/D production ratio shows a behaviour consistent with a model calculation using pp data as input for the parameterisation. The measurement indicates similar values as observed recently by ALICE at midrapidity in pp and in pPb collisions [9]. The large observed values indicate tensions with existing fragmentation fraction measurements in e+eâˆ’ collisions and in ep collisions, see e.g. in [10] for a compilation of LEP data, and warrant further tests of universality in charm hadronisation in pp and pPb collisions. Modiï¬�cations of baryon-to-meson ratios have been observed in light ï¬‚avour production in heavy-ion collisions compared to pp collisions, see e.g. in [11]. The observation of modiï¬�cation patterns in the heavy-ï¬‚avour sector for baryon-to-meson ratios between diï¬€erent collision systems and their investigation as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in the ï¬�nal state may allow us to shed light into the modelling and understanding of these phenomena thanks to the presence of a mass scale much larger than Î›QCD for one of the valence quarks. In pPb collisions, LHCb can contribute to this question at âˆš sNN =8.16 TeV with an integrated luminosity higher by a factor 20 with respect to the data at 5 TeV presented so far. In the quarkonium sector, we report precise measurements of prompt and non-prompt J/Ïˆ in pPb colli- sions at âˆš sNN = 8.16 TeV down to pT = 0 [14]. In Figure 5, the prompt J/Ïˆ production is compared with calculations using diï¬€erent nPDF sets, the coherent energy loss model as well as colour glass condensate 1The results presented here will appear in [12]. They superseed the preliminary results published in 2017 [13]. M. Winn / Nuclear Physics A 982 (2019) 15â€“21 17 Fig. 4.

Model references and detailed discussions are given in [14]. calculations. Similar observations as for the open charm production apply: a strong suppression at low pT down to about 0.5 in the nuclear modiï¬�cation factor at forward rapidity is observed with an approach to unity at the highest transverse momenta and slight modiï¬�cations much closer to unity at backward rapidity. There is no sign of an increase of the nuclear modiï¬�cation factor above unity as for the prompt D0 at the backward edge of the acceptance. A possible physics origin of this apparent diï¬€erence with respect to the D0-result should wait for new measurements of the D0 meson at âˆš sNN = 8.16 TeV. The non-prompt J/Ïˆ production shown in Figure 5 (right panel) exhibits a weaker suppression at low pT in accordance with expectations for nPDF modiï¬�cations. The non-prompt measurements provide the most precise test of b-hadron production in nuclear collisions down to pT = 0 to date and are hence an important step to quantify modiï¬�cations to be anticipated for the analysis of ion-ion data in the quest of modiï¬�cations due to the presence of deconï¬�ned QCD matter in the open beauty and in the bottomonium sector. 4. Heavy-ï¬‚avour production in ï¬�xed-target mode in pAr and pHe collisions The ï¬�xed target data sets of LHCb are a unique chance at the LHC to allow for precise measurements at centre-of-mass energies of around 100 GeV in the backward rapidity hemisphere in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass system. We concentrate at this conference on charm production measurements in proton- induced collisions, that are interesting to constrain nuclear eï¬€ects not related to deconï¬�nement for upcoming analyses in nucleus-nucleus collisions as for example nPDFs as well as to constrain the nature of the partonic M. Winn / Nuclear Physics A 982 (2019) 15â€“2118 Fig. 6. The D0 production cross section as a function of rapidity compared with models, references detailed in [18]. content of nuclei/nucleons. In particular, it has been argued that the proton contains higher excited Fock- state components with an additional valence-like ccÂ¯ quark pair [15]. Due to the coverage getting close to the kinematic edge for heavy-ï¬‚avour production at backward rapidity, the LHCb detector is well suited to have a closer look whether sizeable signs of this conjectured contribution are present. In 2017, LHCb reported for the ï¬�rst time measurements both in the soft sector [16] in view of cosmic ray physics as well as in the charm sector in pAr collisions [17] in its unique ï¬�xed target conï¬�guration. At this conference, we present the results to be published in an upcoming article on D0 and J/Ïˆ produc- tion in pHe and pAr collisions. The measurements in pAr are hence superseeded by the results presented here. New results in pHe featuring cross sections based on an indirect luminosity determination via elastic electron-proton scattering are shown. As a highlight from this data, Figure 6 shows the cross section of D0 as a function of rapidity in pHe collisions [18]. The shape is in reasonable agreement with model calculations not invoking an intrinsic charm contribution to the proton/nuclear wave function. We estimate the Bjorken-x of the partons in the target nucleus. We use x = 2Â·mCâˆšsNN Â· eâˆ’yâˆ— , where mC , âˆš sNN , yâˆ— represent the charm quark mass, the centre-of- mass energy per nucleon-nucleon pair and the D0 rapidity in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass system. Hence, we conclude to be sensitive to a valence-like intrinsic charm contribution in absence of strong nuclear eï¬€ects for 4He2. We see in the distribution rather a deï¬�cit than a relative enhancement of the production cross section at the backward rapidity edge with respect to the calculations without intrinsic charm. Therefore, we do not see a valence-like intrinsic charm signal in our present data based on the distribution shape. 5. Towards direct photon measurements in pPb collisions in collider mode For suitable kinematics, colour neutral ï¬�nal states can avoid to a large extent possible nuclear modiï¬�- cations that are not related to the partonic content of nuclei. In particular, direct photons are a suitable tool to probe the partonic structure at low-x at forward rapidity at hadron colliders to search for signs of gluon saturation. LHCb pursues an eï¬€ort using photons reconstructed in the e+eâˆ’ conversion channel. A target observable is the RÎ³ = NDataincl,Î³/N Data Î³ f romÏ€0 NMC Î³,decay/NÎ³,Ï€0 double ratio extracting the direct photons as an excess over the decay photons inside the inclusive sample. The photons from Ï€0 are found by combining the conversion photons with a photon reconstructed in the calorimeter for a mass ï¬�t. For the measurements on isolated photons in pPb, the pp data sets without applying isolation criteria are regarded as control samples. Figure 7 shows the Î· over Ï€0 production ratio that enters the deï¬�nition of the R-ratio. The results in data are very close to the EPOS simulation ones. On the right hand side, the current double ratio R-measurement at 5 TeV using a simulation for 13 TeV pp data is shown as a function of Î³-pT with the present systematic uncertainty on the photon 2There could be conspirative cancellations of the intrinsic charm component and the EMC eï¬€ect that is hardly constrained for nuclear gluon parton distribution functions by measurements.

This illustration demonstrates the understanding of diï¬€erent pp data samples in terms of diï¬€erent kinematics and ï¬�nal state particle multiplicity at a level of the present systematic uncertainty without an excess being visible in this data set. The measurements of Î³-hadron correlations are also carried out as a complementary approach. Both measurements are unique chances to shed light in the low-x frontier of QCD probed at the highest energy hadron collider. 6. Coherent J/Ïˆ production in ultra-peripheral PbPb collisions Ultra-peripheral collisions in PbPb collisions are an opportunity to probe the nucleus with the quasi-real photon cloud accompanying ultra-relativstic high-charge ions as 82+Pb. We report the ï¬�rst measurement of coherent J/Ïˆ â†’ Î¼+Î¼âˆ’ production by LHCb [20]. Figure 8 demonstrates the capability to separate the coherent from the incoherent production and the continuum. This measurement is sensitive to the gluonic content of the nucleus. On the right hand side, the results are compared with diï¬€erent families of model calculations. With the rapidity range covered by the experimental data points, it is possible to disfavour several model calculations in their present form: a detailed discussion can be found in [20]. Measurements in ultra-peripheral PbPb collisions will strongly proï¬�t from the anticipated 10 times larger recorded integrated luminosity in LHCb for the 2018 run compared to the 2015 data set presented here. M. Winn / Nuclear Physics A 982 (2019) 15â€“2120 7. Summary and Outlook We have presented new results over a variety of diï¬€erent probes to characterise pp and nuclear collisions at the LHC. First measurements of Bose-Einstein correlations in pp collisions have been presented and show qualitatively similar ï¬�ndings as previous measurements at midrapidity. Results on open heavy-ï¬‚avour and quarkonium production show strong suppressions at forward rapidity qualitatively compatible with strong shadowing within nPDFs, gluon depletion via saturation within the colour glass condensate framework or coherent energy loss. The Î›C production has been measured in pPb collisions and its production ratio with respect to D0 shows patterns compatible with a model tuned to the available production measurements in pp collisions. Steps towards measurements of photon production in pPb collisions to probe the nuclear partons with a colour neutral ï¬�nal state in the quest for saturation are highlighted. In ï¬�xed-target collisions, ï¬�rst cross section measurements of D0 production in pHe collisions are shown. They do not show enhancements from data parameterisations and pQCD-based models that do not include intrinsic charm at the backward rapidity edge of the acceptance. Finally, ï¬�rst results from the 2015 PbPb data taking have been presented: coherent J/Ïˆ production in ultra-peripheral collisions to constrain the gluonic content of the nuclear wave function. These diverse measurements point to a large potential of LHCb to probe and characterise the initial state of heavy-ion collisions that is instrumental for the understanding of ion-ion collisions and that waits to be fully exploited in upcoming years. The planned ï¬�rst upgrade for LHC Run 3 improves the detector granularity that will be beneï¬�cial in particular for ion-ion collisions both in ï¬�xed-target collisions starting operations in 2021 [21, 22, 23, 24]. The ï¬�xed-target collision programme will proï¬�t from a new internal gas target with 10-100 times higher useable instantaneous luminosity that is under consideration by the LHCb collaboration at the same time scale. The phase 2 upgrade planned to become operational around 2030, for which an expression of interest has been submitted by the LHCb collaboration, bears the opportunity for an unprecented set-up in ion-ion collisions: a precision low-pT capable detector at forward rapidity using track momenta of minimal ionising particles and above. These upcoming detector improvements for LHCb and the anticipated increased luminosities in the future ion-running at the LHC constitute a unique opportunity for heavy-ion physics that should not be missed.

This work was supported by the following grants: The Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment - Equity Trustees Charitable Foundation100 ng from each RNA bait pool was combined with 100 ng of a specimen library pool for a final volume of 16 μl, and the solution was incubated for a minimum of 20 h at 60 °C. During this process, DNA fragments annealed to RNA baits with homologous sequences. The resulting RNA/DNA hybrid molecules were bound with Dynabeads© Streptavidin C1 beads on a magnetic stand. Another 50 μl of Dynabeads were washed twice with bead wash buffer (1M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween20) and resuspended in a final wash volume of 100 μl. The washed beads were added to each of the library pools at a 2:1 volume ratio. The mixes were left for 30 min at room temperature to allow the Streptavidin/biotin interaction to form. The library pools were then placed on a magnetic stand to separate the RNA/DNA hybrids. The supernatant was removed and 200 μl low stringency wash solution (1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.01% Tween20) added and the pools vortexed. This solution was left for 5 min and the beads separated on a magnetic stand. Preheated low stringency wash solution (60 °C) was used for 3 further washes of 5 min each. After the final separation on the magnetic stand the beads were incubated with 50 μl of 0.2 M NaOH for 10 min to denature the RNA/DNA hybrid molecules. The reaction was neutralised with an equal volume of 1 M Tris-HCl pH8.0. The reaction was then placed on a magnetic stand for a final time. 100 μl of single stranded DNA solution were removed for clean up using 1.8× AMPure beads as previously described. The clean single stranded DNA was then amplified using the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 16 cycles of 98 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 30 s with a final extension step of 72 °C for 5 min.

We observe that although the intellectual material, formed of knowledge, information,  intellectual property and experience, have become the main source of revenues and expenses, it is not sufficiently presented in  the financial situations. Furthermore, the accounting information regarding these intangible resources are poor represented or  even non-existing in these statements.

Introduction  Nowadays, our society is going through multiple changes, changes that have produced mutations in they way  things are perceived at the current moment and in the near future. As a consequence of these changes, the source of  economic values and wealth is represented less by the production of material goods, and more by the creation and  manipulation of information, ideas and knowledge. Therefore, the human intelligence has become a very important  factor for organizations, with the new economy influenced by the intangible assets, such as knowledge and ideas. In  other words, the knowledge has become essential in the economic development of an enterprise, being used to create  competitive advantages in order for the organization to maintain its position on market.      On accounting level, a question is rising: how is the intellectual capital put into value, so that the financial        * Corresponding Author name.

The intangible assets and the intellectual capital-key factors of the convergence      The knowledge, like the intellectual capital, has become a priority, with the former one in comparison with the  tangible assets, and the latter in comparison with other physical forms of capital. In the specialized literature, terms  as intangible assets, intellectual capital or knowledge assets are considered synonyms, (Br  Jianu, 2006).         resources. Therefore, the starting point for researchers from accounting and management fields is represented by  different classification of the intellectual capital. In the accounting literature, a usual classification is the following  one, in which the intellectual capital contains the next four categories of assets, (Curaj et al, 2008).  - Market assets  commercial mark, cession contract, franchising, market segmentations, distribution channels  etc. This type of asset can give to organization competitive advantages;  - Substructure assets  technologies, working methodologies, specific technical proceedings which help the  organization to function efficiently. These types of assets form the culture of an organization, its financial structure,  data bases and management systems;  - Assets as intellectual property  authors copyright, invention brevets, drawings an industrial models, know- how, production secrets etc;  - Human values  abilities and professional experience, knowledge, talents used in specific activities of the  organization. Moreover, the intellectual capital refers not only to the existence of some actives, values or resources,  from the simple presence of resources. An important aspect is the way these resources are put into value, and how a  resource transforms into another one. Another frequently used classification is the one in which the intellectual  capital is structured into three components: the human capital, the structural capital and the relational capital, (Suciu,  2008).   - The human capital   considered the most important resource of an organisation, especially when we talk about the creation of a future  value.  - The structural capital - represents the human capital substructure, including the organisation abilities to adapt to  the requirements of the market, and it contains also the managerial philosophy, the corporatist culture, trade marks,  the intellectual property, management processes and other intangible assets owned by the enterprise, but which are  not registered in the balance sheet. The structural capital is frequently interpreted as containing hardware or other  equipments, interpretation which is wrong because these are only instruments already  register in the financial  situations as assets.  - The relational capital -  creditors, the state, stock market etc.       There are also other classifications of the intellectual capital, but in most cases the differences regard the form  and not the fund. In order to measure and manage in an efficient way the intellectual capital, and to give it a real  dimension, it is important to identify exactly as possible its components.  2.2. The intellectual capital measurement      We observe that the traditional accounting systems reflects a partial (incomplete) reality and the evaluation  instruments offered by these systems are less and less relevant, appropriate for the measurement of the value of  these organizations in which the intangible assets represents the essential source for wealth. To the real value of the  products realized by the organization contribute also the knowledge and the abilities of those who conceived and  produce them, but also the marketing strategy of these organizations that intent to sell these products. These are the  ation, but they are not reflected in the balance sheet.   670   Liana GaË˜daË˜u /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  62 ( 2012 )  668 â€“ 671      The intellectual capital ensures the grey matter of the organization, and the measurement of knowledge as assets  growing number of intangible  factors. One of the traditional accounting limits is that it highlights less or even at all these new intangible assets of  the organization. However, this problem became an interesting subject which was studied by numerous researchers.        We consider that the recognition, evaluation and measurement of the intangible assets is extremely important for  an organization because on one hand it highlight the potential and the real value of the patrimony and on the other  hand these assets need to be presented in the financial situations of an organization in order to reflect as realistically  as possible its activity. We observe that in the specialized literature there are numerous theories and development  models to measure the intellectual capital, an aspect which reflects also the growing interest for the intangible  actives incorporated in this concept.       We will stop at the classification made by Sveiby, (Sveiby, 2001) which groups all the existing approaches for the  intellectual capital measurement into the following categories:  - Models based on the direct evaluation of the intellectual capital- through which the intangible assets value is  estimated through the identification of different components and their separate or together measurement;  - Models that are based on the market value- through which the intellectual capital is obtained as a difference  between the value market of the enterprise and the social capital  - Models based on actives revenues- are based on the traditional concepts of accounting, formulas which include  the brut incomes and other indicators used in the evaluation of the intellectual capital;  - Models based on frame scores- through which the components of the intellectual capital is defined (human,  structural and market capital) and indexes that are highlighted through graphics or charts.      These models are more complex than the financial ones, and incorporate concepts such as the human capital, the  structural capital and market capital. It is considered that these models offer more relevant results as the  measurement of the intellectual capital is concerned, because the approach is more balances, by taking into account  the non- financial aspects. What we want to highlight is that the intangible assets can be measured in the financial  situations, so in order to improve the image of the accounting information of an organization based on knowledge,  we must used these formulas.   2.3. The extension of the accounting objective over the intellectual potential      The financial situations of an organization reflect only a part of the intangible assets, although in many  organizations these have become the main source of revenues and expenses. Although the human resource has an  intellectual character (considered the component which contains the true innovating wealth of an organization), this  resource has a special importance and can produce bigger effects in the growth of value, as against the other  resources, ( , 2003).       We observe that in accounting treatments, in the construction of accounting information, in the drawing up of the  financial situations, this resource it is insufficiently taken into account. In this context of idea, we can state that the  organization in which the intangible assets represents the essential source for wealth. Analyzing the requirements  found in IAS 38 Intangible Assets, we consider that the changes over the content of the international standard must  be applied so that the components of the intellectual capital adapt better to the definition of intangible assets,  regarding the identifiable character of this one, the control over the resources and the existence of some future  economic benefits.    It is very probable that in the actual form of IAS 38 Intangible Assets, without additional observations, a  component of the human capital would not correspond to the criteria specified above, in order to be consider an  intangible asset, therefore the organization would not preset it in the balance sheet at intangible asset section,  although in reality this value, it proportion in the total intangible asset is significant.      Therefore, first the study wants to highlight the necessity of improving the exiting reporting system on the  intellectual capital in general and the intellectual potential in particular, in order to obtain the most realistic image of  the organi making process in a so called economy based on knowledge  In this context, we propose the introduction in the balance sheet ction, after the  Commercial Mark of a new active The intellectual potential  671 Liana GaË˜daË˜u /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  62 ( 2012 )  668 â€“ 671  position Reserves regarding the potential intellectual, proposals which concerns the presentation of a realistic  image of the intellectual potential of an organization (Table 1).

Also, we consider necessary the presentation of additional information in the Notes to the financial situations on  the accounting treatments applied to the intellectual capital, (presently, it does not contain at all or contains little  information on these types of intangible assets). These requirements must be correlated with the content of IAS 1  The financial situation presentation, which in the section where types of information are detailed must refer directly  to the intellectual capital.   3. Conclusion      We consider that the actual modes of financial situations do not correspond to the future presentation of  accounting, accounting which must adapt to the new requirements of the knowledge society. We consider that the  human resource with intellectual capital (which represent the true plus value) must be presented in the field and  object of the accounting, an accounting treatment must be applied, so that a complex, credible and pertinent  information is presented. This aspect does not exclude the other components of the intellectual capital, for which the  accounting must find adequate accounting treatment regarding the recognition, evaluation and presentation in the  financial statements, so that the wealth would not remain hidden (unidentified) or ignored just because of the  insufficiencies of the actual accounting system.

Using  hypnosis  to  induce  altered  states  of  consciousness  (ASC)  to  the  experimental  group  (N  =  18,  M  =  21.1  years,  SD  =   2.41), at dummy response type investigation, we found that the signal transmission via adrenal-somatic axis up to  manifestations is processed in a longer time than the signal transmission from the Ideo-Motor Reflex centers of the two  cerebral hemispheres at effectors muscles which decode the transmitted signal. Under these conditions, the measured response  time differences using polygraph and pressure sensors for Ideo-Motor Reflex signal, are given by the complexity of intra- psychic processing of related facets of specific aspects of the Self.

Introduction  The term personality has its origins in the Latin word ""persona"", meaning ""mask"". Ancient theater actors used  masks not to hide their identity, but to represent, to characterize the character..  Contemporary, some authors define (Opre et al, 2002) [1] personality (even if as a working hypothesis) by  referring to those characteristics of a person that justify the consistency of his behavioral patterns.  The personality unity, instability, and increased duplication are based on a core element, fundamental as the  core of personality, represented by the Self, with all its aspects: Mine, Self, Myself.  The psychosocial stage (from the eighth decade so far) marks a rediscovery of the Self as an organizer of  knowledge and as regulator of conduct, all on an affective-emotional basis.

After Golu (2002) [3], the Self includes three interrelated and mutually integrated components, so called Selfâ€™s  facets:  1. The physical (somatic) Self - the valued image of the body's internal environment and physical constitution,  emotional experiences related to them.  2. The psychological Self - the image of self psychical internal organization, the internal emotional  experiences related to it, the motivation - the need of self-realization, of self-improvement.  3. Social Self â€“ the image of their place and role in society, the internal social values internalized and  integrated system, the social reasons, the status reasons, social emotions, social integration will.  Intra-psychic conflict refers to a conflict between different levels of the psyche: conscious, subconscious and  unconscious when they show different facets of ego (self somatic, ego). An attitude, behaviour or a rational  cognition is the result of the disjunction between action and inner conviction regarding the content of certain  facets of the Self.  1.1. The polygraph technique  Mitrofan, Butoi, Zdrenghea, (1992) [4] show that the polygraph technique detects the emotion indirectly by  detecting the general trigger reactions, involving both central and peripheral physiological mechanisms. These  reactions can be identified because they are transmitted by the autonomic nervous system, which deals with the  subconscious vital activity (Anitei et al., 2009) [5]. It is considered that the onset of the emotional-somatic  reactions accompanies the subjectâ€™s response to the ""concerns"" issue, and these reactions are shown in the  polygraph records of the physiological parameters.  2. Objectives  Highlighting the intra-psychic conflicts that refer to the Selfâ€™s facets, using induced hypnosis, by measuring  the emotional reactivity with the help of the polygraph and of the pressure sensor for the SIM ideo-motor reflex  signal.  3. Hypotheses  When responding questions about the Selfâ€™s facets statistically significant differences were registered by the  polygraphâ€™s sensors in ASC (altered state of consciousness) opposed to OSC (ordinary state of consciousness).  4. Method  4.1. Participants  To test the general hypothesis the pair-groups experimental design was used, using only the experimental  group. The group consisted of a number of 18 students of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences,  University of Bucharest, aged between 18 and 25 years old, 3 boys and 15 girls, (m= 21.1 years, SD = 2.41 ).  4.2. Apparatus and instruments  To highlight the ideo-motor reflex response we used the polygraph or the so-called ""lie detector"" is an  instrument that measures physiological reactions, equipped with two channels to measure the thoracic and  735 Aliodor Manolea /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  78 ( 2013 )  733 â€“ 737  abdominal respiration, an electrodermal response measuring channel and one for blood pressure and heart rate  measuring channel. The FSR pressure sensor is coupled with an automatic system signal acquisition.  4.3. The working procedure  Through this procedure we aimed to obtain data which show the influence of induced hypnosis on emotional  reactivity. These data were highlighted in the physiological parameters records using the polygraph machine  when an altered state of consciousness (ASC) is induced, maintained and deepened in the students from the  experimental group, and it is then measured using the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, form C. Students  answered to questions that evoke the many facets of Self. Ideo-motor reflex response data were also recorded to  reveal a way for assessing the state of intra-psychic conflict.  4.4. Experimental design   We used a pretest-posttest matched-pairs experimental design. The independent variable was the applied  psychotherapeutic technique - induced hypnosis. The dependent variables describe the somatic and psycho- emotional states of the subjects and consist of the following: electro-dermal response amplitude, time to return,  EDA resistance value, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate - all measured with the polygraph and the  response time measured with the pressure sensor.  5. Results  For the polygraph obtained data none of the dependent variables has the values normally distributed. In  applying Wicoxon nonparametric tests statistically significant differences were confirmed for both sides of the  Self. So, for the somatic Self statistically significant differences of the responses given in ASC to those given in  OSC for the dependent variables: time to return (Z = -7.48 p = 0.000 <0.001), EDA resistance value (Z = - 8.23 p  = 0.000 <0.001), blood pressure (Z = -4.99 p = 0.000 <0.001) and respiratory rate (Z = -3.55 p = 0.000 <0.001).  No statistically significant results were found for the dependent variables electro-dermal response amplitude (Z =  -1.41 p = 0.159> 0.05) and heart rate (Z = -1.61 p = 0.1> 0.05).  For the psychological Self statistically significant differences, of the responses given in OSC opposed to those  given in ASC, were registered for the dependent variables: time to return (Z = -6.94 p = 0.000 <0.001), EDA  resistance value (Z = -7.32 p = 0.000 <0.001), heart rate (Z = -2.61 p = 0.009 <0.01), blood pressure (Z = -4.25 p  = 0.000 <0.001) and respiratory rate (Z = -3.85 p = 0.000 <0.001). Statistically significant results for the  dependent variable amplitude electro-dermal response (Z = - 0.14 p = 0.89> 0.05) were not revealed.  6. Discussions  The subjects in the experimental group were in an induced hypnotic trance while being in the ASC. The  previous statement is strengthened by the fact that the response time (time to return) of the autonomic nervous  system (ANS) is longer than in OSC. In the ordinary state of consciousness (OSC) a rational binary answer (RA)  was given, and at subconscious level information processing took place; this was manifested as a subconscious  answer (SA) and also it was manifested at the level of the physical body, level where different parameters were  registered (fig.1a).  The possible relations between the rational, subconscious and unconscious answers (UA) can be grouped as  follows: RA SA UA showing an absence of inner conflict, and RA SA UA, RA SA UA and  RA SA UA  showing that an inner conflict exists and that it is situated at different psychic depths (Fig. 1b).  736   Aliodor Manolea /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  78 ( 2013 )  733 â€“ 737  To this response types we can associate specific response times as follows: t 0  specific for RA, t 1  specific for  SA, t 2  specific for UA and t 3  specific for AIDM (ASC response time using SIDM).   When a question is asked in OSC, a type dummy verbal response is registered (RA) at t 0  time, and the  polygraph sensors register the subconscious response (SR) processed at t 1  time, resulting that t 1 >t 0.      Do you feel good about your body image?  t 1 = 37s              t 2 = 3min 20s SA                                 UA      Fig. 1. (a) Example-differentiations of parameter values recorded with polygraph equipment that have meaning that there is a intra-psychic  conflict between the subconscious (SA) and unconscious (UA) levels relating to the physical (somatic) Self. (b) . Example of the graphical  differentiation of the intensity (size) of the intra-psychic conflict regarding the physical (somatic) Self as a response to the question ""Do you  feel good about your body image? (Electro-dermal activity parameter)  After the subject was put into a cataleptic ASC, verified with the Stanford hypnotic susceptibility scale, and the  question corresponding to the desired Self facet is put, the polygraph records show the relationship between t 2 , t1  and t0.  In the altered state of consciousness (ASC) the information processing was made at an unconscious level and  the appropriate answer was obviously manifested at the same psychical level (UA). In accordance with our  findings, we have built the table 1.  Table 1. The relation between the response times in OSC and ASC  Action Consciousness state Response type\t response time Relation between the response times  Questioning OSC RA/ t 0  SA/t 1  t 1 >t 0  ASC UA/ t 2  t 2 > t 1>  t 0   OSC/SIDM AIDM/ t 3  t 0<  t 3<  t 1     We can observe that a longer time is required (t 1 >t 3 ) for the signals transmission through the adrenal axis (path  1) to take form in somatic manifestations (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, sweat activity), than it is  required for the signal to be transmitted from ideo-motor reflex centers of the two cerebral hemispheres (path 2)  to the effectors muscles.   In these circumstances the question is: is the response time difference given only by the route followed by the  signal (path 1 or path 2), or also by the complexity of intra-psychic processing, regarding the subject of the  investigation (a specific aspect of Self facets) appropriate to the state of the subject at the time of the inquiry.  Another aspect of the problem regarding the response time is that of the depth of the intra-psychic level that  undergoes the processing caused by the specific Self facet investigated at the moment. We assume that UA is  given by the intra-psychic unconscious level and that the answer required a certain amount of time to pass  between the moment of the question and the polygraph registration of the somatic parameters. Considering the  737 Aliodor Manolea /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  78 ( 2013 )  733 â€“ 737  issues raised, it can be assumed that the response time is directly related, perhaps even directly proportional to the  intensity of internal conflict, of the psychosomatic conditionings (Fig. 1b).  The question is: the time necessary to an inner process to physical manifest itself, represents the time required  for intra-psychic processing of the data at an unconscious level and the transmission of the information resulting  as an algorithm for the autonomic nervous system (which in return processes the data and shows a response that  can be registered with the polygraph) or this time interval is required for the information processing although it is  contradictory to the level of the intra-psychic instances at which the investigation takes place.  The objective of this study was to show that these intra-psychic conflicts can be highlighted in altered states of  consciousness using a pressure sensor (FRS-Force Sensitive Sensor) showing the ideo-motor reflex signal  (SIDM). In Table 2 we can see how this becomes possible.  Table 2. Highlighting the intra-psychic conflict (the psychosomatic conditioning) through comparing the answers to the questions regarding  the facets of the Self, in ordinary state of consciousness (OSC) and in an altered state of consciousness (ASC) using the ideo-motor reflex  signal (SIDM) for a single subject  Self facets  Somatic Self   Psychological Self  Question 1 2 3 4 5  6 7 8 9  Answer OSC NO NO NO NO YES   NO NO NO NO  Answer ASC YES NO YES YES YES  YES YES YES NO  Intra psychic conflict YES NO YES YES NO  YES YES YES NO    By comparing the binary answers recorded in the ordinary state of consciousness (SOC), when four of the  subjects connected to the polygraph gave rational answers verbalizing the response option (RA) and the answers  recorded in an altered state of consciousness (ASC) with the ideo-motor reflex signal (SIDM) the presence of  intra-psychic conflicts, of psychosomatic conditioning, can be well noticed. Although this is a highlight with the  character of a pilot experiment, requiring further research in this direction, the study highlights the link between  rational beliefs and those non-rational one implements at an unconscious/subconscious level that can influence  psycho-emotional balance and even health.

Introduction  The mental processes aiming unconscious personal construction in what we call implicit emotional memory  can produce different symptoms manifested in all plans of existence. In psycho-quantum therapy in the first  instance, a change that transforms takes place and aims at those mental processes generating symptoms, those  unconscious personal constructions from implicit emotional memory and, subsequently, a selective  depotentialization of these concepts occurs, stopping the production of symptoms. Neuroscientists have found  that depotentialization of the synapses that encode memory is accompanied by concomitant disappearance of  behavioral responses caused by the memory (Bailey & Kandel, 1993). Simultaneously with the elimination of the  symptom generating constructs their related neural circuits are deleted as well and thus new circuits and  constructions are created by the phenomenon of neuroplasticity - synaptic changes and subjective attention  emerges as a critical agent of change (Ecker & Toomey, 2008).

The purpose of this research was to identify the ways in which applied therapies to subjects results a higher  degree of existential integration when using psychotherapeutic techniques in altered states of consciousness  (ASC). It is also aimed to highlight a specific psychotherapeutic action, applied to improve specific human  quantum field parameters, being able to demonstrate that the psychotherapeutic intervention in altered states of  consciousness (ASC) using QDP Psycho-quantum therapy (Quantum Deep Psychotherapy) causes a somatic and  psycho-emotional balancing.  2. Objectives  2.1. Identification of the QDP technique influence on the somatic and psycho-emotional state, measured with  GDV equipment.   2.2. Highlighting the temporal evolution of the dependent variables corresponding to the somatic psycho- emotional state after applying the QDP technique in a single session, measured with the GDV equipment at the  baseline of the study, for two participants.  3. Hypotheses  QDP psycho-quantum therapy significantly influences the results obtained by measuring the parameters of the  human quantum field with Bio-Photonic sensor (GDV).  Specific hypotheses were issued for the dependent variables: field area, normalized field area, average  intensity, form factor, and the average radius of isolines corresponding to the somatic and psycho-emotional  states.  4. Method  4.1. Participants  The study group was composed of 38 subjects, men and women (M = 38.4 SD = 2.87) and two subjects (one  woman and one man) participated in the study with repeated measurements conducted for 1,200 hours.  4.2. Apparatus and instruments  The devices used for determining electro-photonic stimulated emission were GDV Camera Pro and the device  for human quantum field state highlighting AV 5.1. The GDV device measures the human quantum field  parameters using the Kirlian method and the AV 5.1 apparatus determines the same field characteristics through  electro-dermal response and hand temperature measurement. For data analyzing we used SPSS 20, Excel 2010  and GDV Scientific Laboratory programs.  4.3. Working procedure  At the beginning of the research, the quantum emission parameters, biological and optical stimulated by  electromagnetic fields were measured using the GDV device, for all participants. The action was repeated within  two hours after applying the psychotherapeutic techniques. For the two participants in the study with repeated  measurements personal electro-dermal parameters measurements were made with the AV5.1 device at intervals  determined by the Fibonacci series, which is defined by the following recurrence formula:  740   Aliodor Manolea /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  78 ( 2013 )  738 â€“ 742  F0 = 0, F1 = 1 and Fi = i-1 + Fi-2 for i  2, and set terms of the form {...} 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21.  Fibonacci series was chosen to mark the sequential intervals of the measurements, because the defined  numberâ€™s recurrence characterize the phenomenology of the biological system growth (Douady & Couder, 1996).  The psychotherapeutic intervention lasted 15 minutes for each subject, using QDP therapy.  4.4. Experimental design  The experimental design used was one using repeated measures before and after the application of the QDP  technology. The independent variable was represented by the QDP psychotherapeutic technique.  The dependent variables describe the psycho-emotional and somatic states of the subjects participating in the  research: quantum field area, normalized quantum field area, average intensity, form factor, and the average  radius of isolines, all measured with the GDV device.  5. Results  After applying these statistical tests we revealed that some variables are normally distributed and some are  not. The fulfill condition of normality is based on the fact that p> 0.05.  Some histograms representing the distributions of the values of the dependent variable corresponding to the  somatic and psycho-emotional state are shown below.                average radius of the isoline after therapy  average intensity of the field after therapy    Fig. 1.Histograms representing the distribution of the values of the dependent variables average intensity, the average radius of isolines  corresponding to somatic state  5.1. Testing the hypotheses  The applied statistical analysis (t and Wilcoxon tests) for the dependent variables corresponding to the somatic  state, quantum field area, normalized quantum field area, average intensity, form factor, and the average radius of  isolines show that there are no statistically significant differences (p> 0.05) after QDP therapy application.  For the psycho-emotional state the averages of the group before and after QDP therapy show that there are  statistically significant differences for the variables: quantum field area (13741.4 + / -2563.5 <15009.25 + / - 2534.93 t (37) = - 4.38 p = 0.000 <0.05), normalized quantum field area (1.71 + / -0.54 <1.90 + / -0.64 t (37) = -  3.75 p = 0.000 <0.05), mean radius of isolines (12.63 + / -3.19 <14.03 + / -3.15 t (37) = - 4.15 p = 0.000 <0.05),  while for the dependent variable average intensity  the hypothesis was not confirmed (p = 0.417> 0.05). The  application of non-parametric Wilcoxon test for the dependent variable form coefficient corresponding to the  psycho-emotional state, shows that there are statistically significant differences (Z = -3.83 p = 0.000 <0.05) after  applying the QDP therapy.    741 Aliodor Manolea /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  78 ( 2013 )  738 â€“ 742  Descriptive statistic for dependent variables of the study with repeated measurements:       Fig. 2.The temporal evolution graphic for the dependent variable quantum field area  We  note  that,  in  the  first  step  (the  first  ten  hours)  the  values  of  the  quantum  field  area  corresponding  to   somatic state (red route) decrease, while the values of the same variable for the psychosomatic state increase  (blue route). After this period, the values of the variable quantum field area varies in phase (increase and decrease  simultaneously) for both states, somatic and psycho-emotional. The same behavior appears for the dependent  variables normalized quantum field area, average intensity and average radius of isolines.  In the first ten hours, the values of the form coefficient corresponding the quantum field for the somatic state  (red path) increases, while the same variable values for the psychosomatic state decrease (blue route). After this  period, the values of the form factor of the quantum field variable varies in phase (rise and fall simultaneously)  for both states, somatic and psycho-emotional, for both subjects.  6. Discussion  Of the five variables corresponding the general hypothesis 1 studied for the psycho-emotional state, only one -  the average intensity of the quantum field has no statistically significant effects, but the other four had different  statistically significant values, confirming that QDP psycho-quantum therapy is effective. It should be noted that  the measurement of the variables was performed a few minutes before and immediately after therapy.  Also that fact that for the somatic state none of the dependent variables revealed significant effects could be  explained if we consider the longitudinal study. This study shows the time evolution of the dependent variables  above, showing how the therapeutic technique works. At the somatic level, in the first 10-20 hours a decrease in  the value of dependent variables quantum field area, normalized quantum field area, average intensity occurs,  while for the same dependent variables in the psycho-emotional state, it is increasing. This increase is due to the  decrease of the dependent variables corresponding to the somatic state, redistribution, a reshaping of the human  quantum field whose parameters are measured takes place. Therefore, it is normal to record a decrease in the  dependent variables listed in the somatic state, the statistical analysis is showing that nothing significant  happened in this state. The somatic state is, in this sense, a reservoir that supplies energy restores the energy  corresponding to the psycho-emotional state. Under these conditions, as the study with repeated measurements  shows, in order to reveal the effects that occur in the somatic state, it is necessary to repeat measurements at an  interval greater than 10 hours after application of the psychotherapeutic techniques. Increasing values of the  dependent variables field area normalized field area and mean radius of isolines means a positive evolution of the  psycho-emotional state, while declining values for the form factor (associated with the degree of uniformity,  742   Aliodor Manolea /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  78 ( 2013 )  738 â€“ 742  homogeneity of human quantum field) shows a tendency of the quantum field to reorganize in order to achieve  new potentials.  7. Conclusions  Values obtained and registered  with the experimental apparatus, the increasing or decreasing values, as  appropriate, of the variables measured, shows that  the QDP psychotherapeutic technique had positive effects,  especially that it was applied for 15 minutes and was performed once for each subject in hand, at the beginning of  the experiment. The technique causes a structural reorganization of the human quantum field, a redistribution of  it, leading to uniformity of intensity, in spatial continuity (form coefficient decreases as the average radius  isolines increases).As a temporal interval of technique reapplication (see field area and normalized field area) a  value of 70-100 hours (3-4 days) results for the integration of the transformation. In fact, this value is found in  the following graphic illustration of the temporal evolution of a living system (Douady & Couder, 1996),  obtained by interpreting the Fibonacci series elements in terms of geometry. Fibonacci series was chosen to mark  the sequential intervals of the measurements because the recurrences of the defined numbers characterize the  living phenomenology as a whole.      Fig. 3. The temporal evolution graphic of a biological system according the Fibonacci series )[6]  As can be seen, if one considers that a square is a temporal interval, resuming the evolutionary cycle at a  higher level occurs in three intervals, obtained by the study with repeated measurements.  After this period, the human quantum field parameters vary (increase or decrease simultaneously) to achieve  homeostasis.  References  Bailey, C. H., & Kandel, E. (1993).

This is supported by the  growing number of world's Muslim community estimated to increase to 1.8 billion by 2011 with current halal market  value estimated to reach USD2.3 billion. However, there are some issues regarding the halal industry either  domestically or internationally, particularly in relation to the abuse of halal logo and other offenses relating to the  halal logo. The question is arised whether the rights of Muslims were fully protected under the relevant laws and  their lawfully rights if these laws were not adhered to? The objective of this article is to examine a preamble to the  highlight of consumer protection in Malaysia and its application. The research methodology is by documentations  analysis based on literature review and the outcome of this writing would be an improvement in consumer protection  and consumerâ€™s comprehension in matters related to halal products, to protect and educate consumers, and to educate  producers to be more vigilant and responsible for the manufacture of their products.

Halim et al. /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  121 ( 2014 )  68 â€“ 78  1.  Introduction  Consumerism is perceived as an essential component of the Islamic economic system that brings  together the elements of material and maknawi. It also considers the maslahat of individuals and groups.  The Islamic jurists have created the theory of consumer product consisting of three elements: 1 â€“ the  contracting element or aqad, 2 - moral element, and 3 â€“ the sharia element. The members of Islamic  jurisprudence are also linking consumerism with Islamic economic theory. Thus, they make consumerism  as a basic component of the Islamic economic system as mentioned earlier. With this, the jurists apply  conditions or dawabit and methodology that enjoins together the sharia principles and changes of ijtihad.   In general, the term consumerism in Islam refers to a person who obtains such goods or services to  meet their needs while achieving legitimate purposes in accordance with the Islamic law 2 . In matters  involving a purchase, Islam emphasizes the question of quality and consumer's rights. Quality of the  goods sold shall be guaranteed and satisfactory and meet the needs of consumers in return for the price  they paid. In discussing the issue of consumerism, halal (lawful) or haram (unlawful) status of a product  is very important for Muslim consumers as it relates to religious claims. Therefore, any law or regulation  designed must take these claims into account.   There are a lot of abuse relating to the use of halal logo, especially when it relates to food and  products. The question then arised whether the rights of Muslims were fully protected under the law  relating to halal, and what are their lawfully rights if these rules were not adhered to or ignored? For  example, the question of whether the basic ingredient of a food product complies with sharia and how  Muslim consumers are protected in issues like this?   The objective of this article is to look at past studies related to consumer protection and its application  in halal products. The mass media exposures of fraudulent use of halal logo, and haram food ingredients  illegally sold as 'halal' in the market in this country, from time to time, prove the problem is not a new  issue. Halal issue boils down to three basic things; Muslim consumer attitudes towards the value of halal  food purchased, the seller attitude whether they respect the Muslim taboos, and enforcement in terms of  the law 3  and legal action, whether they are sufficient to curb the frauds of halal logo.   When debating the issue of halal, the scope is very wide covering halal food, halal banking 4 , halal  pharmaceutical products, halal service financing, halal holiday and others.    2. Halal and Consumerism    Based on historical fact, John F. Kennedy, the late president of the United States was the first to  highlight the idea of consumer protection for the public through the Declaration of Consumer Rights. This  Declaration was presented to the U.S. Congress on March 15, 1961. There were four basic rights declared  during that time, which were 5 :  1. The right to safety  2. The right to be informed  3. The right to choose  4. The right to be heard    2  Abdul Karim, Faris Hamid. 2009.

Halim et al. /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  121 ( 2014 )  68 â€“ 78  The concept of consumer rights then expanded its scope to other rights as was mooted by Anwar  Fazal, the President of the International Organization of Consumers Unions (IOUC), which were 6 :    1. The right to satisfaction of basic needs  2. The right to healthy environment  3. The right to redress  4. The right to consumer education  5. The right to representation    For the protection of consumers from profiteering misconduct of producers and sellers, there have  been various policies, statutes and plannings introduced by the government of many countries, world  organizations, and consumer organizations at national and international levels such as the United Nations  Guidelines for Consumer Protection, the EU Consumer Policy Strategy (2007 - 2013), the Regulation  (EU) on Consumer Protection Cooperation, ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint, Consumer  Basic Act (Japan), and the National Consumer Policy (Malaysia) 7 .   The United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection or the guidelines for the United Nations  Consumer Protection (UNGCP) were the guidelines introduced by the world organization on 9 April 1985  based on the proposal submitted by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, one of the  administrative machinery of the Organization United Nations 8 . Although it is not binding, however, it  provides a framework of term of references to be used by the United Nations countries with regard to the  implementation of consumer protection.   Generally, the main objective of these guidelines is to assist the government to provide for adequate  protections to consumers, prevent unethical acts among businesses, and help create an independent  consumer body or association in a country. In addition, it has also outlined seven consumer rights and  requirements entitled to consumers to be provided by businesses, namely: protection from hazards to  health and safety; improve and safeguard the interest of the consumer economy; the right to have access  to adequate information on the product; the right for education including the implications of consumer  choices on the environment, economy and social; the existence of an effective law to consumers; freedom  to form associations or consumer organizations; and the opportunity for the organizations to present their  views in decision-making processes in order to promote for sustainable consumption.   In Southeast Asia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has proposed for an Asean  Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint in their mission to form an independent economic community by  2015 9 . Among the plans being made to prepare the consumers on the emergence of the free market  community is through the establishment of ASEAN Committee on Consumer Protection (ACCP) 10 . The  function of ACCP would be to act on behalf of the protection of consumerâ€™s interests. In addition, a  consumer agency network will be established with aims to promote information sharing and exchanges on  products, services and other relevant matters. To ensure that all ASEAN citizens have the knowledge and  skills to enforce consumer protection laws and regulations, trainings will be conducted from time to time  for government officials and leaders of consumer organizations 11 .   The National Consumer Policy (NCP) was introduced in 1990 by the National Consumer Advisory  Council established under the Consumer Protection Act 1999, with aims to balance the rights and    6  ibid  7  United Nations guidelines for consumer protection (as expanded in 1999).

The  main goal of NCP is to provide for full protection to consumers through the cooperation of  supplier/manufacturer in implementing the concept of self-protection, as well as government  involvement. To ensure this can be achieved, a number of areas need to be emphasized, namely: the  legislature, trade practices, education, health, public facilities, and other related areas 13 .   The objective of NCP is the utmost level of consumer protection; accountable and fair trade practices;  education; sustainable consumption in the present globalization era; and relationship between consumers,  suppliers/manufacturers and the government 14 .  The target mission of NCP is to improve consumer welfare; improve socio-economic well-being; and  increase sustainable consumption practices. Several strategies have been outlined which can be  categorized into two, i.e. consumer protection in terms of social, and also legal. The adoption of social  strategy would be to improve quality of life; increase self-protection; increase support and assistance to  consumerism movements; and encourage participations of consumer organizations in the formulation and  implementation of government programs at the state and district levels. Whilst from the legal point of  view, the strategy would be to strengthen the laws of consumer protection by reenforcing the existing  laws and regulations, to amend the laws in accordance with the current development, creating new laws  that take into account the impact of globalization, trade liberalization and sustainable consumption,  ensuring for the laws to guarantee consumerâ€™s welfare and well-being.   NCP does not clearly state the rights of consumers but on the other hand states the  responsibilities  essential to all consumers and those are 15 :    1. Awareness to criticize  2. Involvement and action  3. Social responsibility  4. United    The National Consumer Advisory Council, a body that serves to advise the Minister in the Ministry of  Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism, has outlined eight rights the consumers must know, as  follows 16 :    1. The right to choose  2. The right to safety  3. The right to be informed  4. The right to be heard   5. The right to redress and remedy  6. The right to environmental health  7. The right to service   8. The right to consumer education:    Halal has been a long-debated issue, but today, this issue has become increasingly complex as a result  of rapid expansion in innovation and technology. Halal has also been gaining attention not only locally  and domestically, but also globally. The era of globalization has brought many challenges to consumers.  In Malaysia, consumers are also facing many problems in consumerism issues which are not limited in    12  t.p. National Consumer Policy. http://www.nccc.org.my. On-line.

Dishonesty in business practices such as poor quality goods, exhorbitant  prices, cheating in weighing, counterfeiting of goods, lack of quality control or standards in trade  merchandise control and other forms of frauds that exist in Malaysia at the moment 17 . Not to exclude  animal based daily consumer products such as handbags, belts, shoes and many more. The issue is the  source of the products if they were taken from the animals halal to be consumed by the Muslims? Even if  the source is halal, the next issue would be the processing techniques and methods if it was done in  accordance with the Islamic law or not? All these problems plaguing the consumers should be resolved  immediately without haste by the relevant authorities 18 .   Whenever the word halal is mentioned, it indirectly relates to consumerism issues. Consumerism is an  important issue that should be addressed by all nations, how they can best look after the welfare and well- being of their people is reflected through the policies and laws they enacted and enforced 19 ..  There have been various goods flooding the business market in Malaysia and amongst these goods  are, imitation and couterfeit goods, misleading advertisements, causing further grievances and problems  to consumers due to harmful preservatives and dyes in foods and drugs, that are banned in developed  countries but are sold without restrictions in developing countries like Malaysia 20 . The dangers arising  from various products and food ingredients supposedly should not have the halal status, and if there was,  the status is questionable.  3. Halal in Sharia  Some of the Muslims choose their favourite food based on affordability, wants and taste. They are  doing so by only looking at the deliciousness and the nutrients contents without assessing whether it is  edible especially from the aspect of hygiene and its permissibility in Islam. Allah says in Surah Al- Baqarah (The Heifer 2:172):    Ø§ ÙŽ Ø§ ÙŠ ÙŽ Ù‡ Ù�Ù‘ ÙŠ ÙŽ Ø°Ù�ÙŠÙ†ÙŽ  Ø£ ÙŽÙ‘ ÙˆØ§ Ø§Ù„ Ù� Ù† ÙŽ ÙˆØ§ Ø¢Ù… Ù� Ù„ Ù� Ùƒ   Ù’ Ù† Ù� Ø§ØªÙ�  Ù… ÙŽ Ø¨ Ù� Ù‘ÙŠ ÙŽ Ø§ Ø· ÙŽ Ù…   Ù’ Ù… Ù� Ù†Ø§ÙŽÙƒ Ù’ Ø²ÙŽÙ‚ ÙŽ Ø±     â€œO ye who believe! Eat of the good things that we have provided for you.â€�    The meaning of â€˜good thingsâ€™ from the above phrase includes hygienic food because when it is  hygienic it means it is indeed good. A cleanse and hygienic food will guarantee a healthy body.  Therefore, beside choosing a healthy and nutrientious food, it is best to emphasize the aspect of  cleanliness and hygienic according to the teaching of Islam. The Prophet SAW (peace be upon him) said:    Ø¨Ù‡ Ø£ÙˆÙ„Ù‰ Ù�Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ø± Ø³Ø­Øª Ù…Ù† Ù†Ø¨Øª Ù„Ø­Ù…Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù†Ø© ÙŠØ¯Ø®Ù„ Ø£Ù† Ø£Ø¨Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø¥Ù†     â€œIndeed Allah prohibited flesh grown from forbidden source to enter paradise, on the contrarily, hell  is the best place for it.â€�(Hadis riwayat Al-Hakim).      17  Sakina Shaik Ahmad Yusoff. 2000.

A Muslim who always  cares  about the aspects of cleanse and hygienic food daily will surely emit a spiritual ray of light within his  body to maintain the same hygienic approach in his clothing, abode and bodily upkeep and et cetera.

But if one is forced by necessity,  without wilful disobedience, not transgressing due limits, then Allah is oft forgiving and most merciful.â€�  Based on the verses above, it is clear that Islam has its own guidelines on how to source for a good  and halal food. The same is translated to the Halal Standard MS1500:2009 food preparation by which  halal food is defined as food and beverages with contents that are permissible according sharia.  4. Fraudulent Halal Logo  In the case of fraud against halal logo, there are several types of frauds including the subsequent  misuse of the halal logo upon the business acquirement of the logo, the use of over expired halal  compliance certificate, or companies that have never obtained the halal certificate and instead have used a  forged one 21 . If the fraud is only confined to the cheating of halal logo per se, it may not pose as a big  issue to consumers. However, what would be critical is the businesses that use halal logo in their products  but after further investigation and testing were showed traces of alcohol and DNA of pig in the content  which is clearly prohibited in Islam. Many cases of occurance in Malaysia which have been reported by  the mainstream media in Malaysia.  The source from the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism (MDTCC) reported  of six forged halal logo, resembling the Islamic Development Department of Malaysia (JAKIMâ€™s) halal  logo, are in the market. Due to fear of drop in sales, some of the kopitiam restaurant owners began to  panic and resorted in buying privately issued halal logo to trick the Muslim consumers 22 . The fake halal  logo is displayed on the door at the payment counter of the premises to convince the already increasingly  cautious customers after knowing not all kopitiam restaurants have applied for halal certification from  JAKIM. Most consumers are not aware of the scam following the imitation of halal logo that is similar to  the halal logo issued by JAKIM 23 .  In the case of slaughtered animal, The Royal Malaysian Custom (JKDM) Selangor confiscated a total  of 22,750 kilogram of frozen beef valued at RM342, 150. The status of its halal is doubtful after JKDM  raided a container in North Port which was declared containing a load of carrots but after further checking    21  Mustafa â€˜Afifi Ab.

During the month of Ramadan in 2010 (1431H), JAKIM and MDTCC jointly conducted Buffet  Ramadan Operations from 1st until 28th Ramadan 1431H. It was found that 50 hotels and restaurants  (52%) of the 96 premises checked were halal noncompliance to the halal standard of JAKIM and JAIN 25 .  Among the findings were the use of raw materials based on alcohol, doubtful contents, nonhalal  certification of halal raw materials, chicken from unclear sources and the mixing of halal and nonhalal  raw materials at the loading bays, storage and the use of Malaysian halal logo without the valid halal  certificate issued by JAKIM and JAIN 26 .  Based on the cases mentioned above, the acts of trickery and false misrepresentations on the part of  the sellers were profound especially in the use of halal logo, which was alarming. However, it was  difficult for the authorities to take actions due to limited enforcement powers of JAKIM and States  Religious Departments as well as lacked of evidence for prosecution.  It is a clear persecution to the consumers especially to the Muslim consumers wanting a halal food or  product. Thus, an establishment and development of a consumer protection model is critical to safeguard  the rights of consumers essentially the halal products and products as a whole.  5. The Halal Laws and Consumers Protection in Malaysia  Among the laws in Malaysia that oversee the distribution of goods that give protection to the rights of  consumers are Contract Act 1950, Sales of Goods Act (SGA) 1957, and Consumer Protection Act 1999.  The Contract Act for example only emphasizes the existence of a contract, escape clause and remedy  without detailed analysis of the contract contents. The Sales of Goods Act (SGA) was drafted to counter  and remedy the loopholes. Unfortunately, SGA is only applicable to the states in the Peninsula Malaysia.  For the states of Sabah and Sarawak, most of the case judgements relating to mercantile were adjudged by  the application of Section 5(2) of the Civil Law Act 1956 which among other stated that goods sales laws  applicable in East Malaysia â€œâ€¦must be the same as what being administered in England in matters  similar at the time as though the issue is raised or ought to be adjudged in Englandâ€¦â€� 27 .  Thus to create a valid goods 28  sales contract, all the basic elements of contract forming must be  present 29  as outlined in Contract Act 1950. Meanwhile, the detailed descriptive of goods can be found in  Sales of Goods Act (SGA) 1957. Among others it centred on the provision which gives advantages to  consumers regarding the liability of the sellers if they default on any implied terms either conditions 30  or  warranties 31  as outlined in Section 14, 15, 16 and 17 of the Act. Section 14 covers three implied terms â€“  implied condition which gives the seller a legal ownership of goods sold, implied warranty which gives  the buyer the pleasure to ownership of goods without harassment and implied warranty that the goods are  free from any encumbrances or claims from a third party. In addition, Section 15 to Section 17 relate to    24  Anon. 2011. Kastam Rampas Daging Beku ekor Lembu Diragui Halal (Custom Seizes Suspicious Halal Frozen Meat).

Pp. 4.  26  ibid.  27  This provision invites debate among academics on the law applicable to Sabah and Sarawak whether Act 1979 or Act 1893 (Sale  of Goods Acts 1893 or 1979) as discussed by (Yusoff, 2007).  28  Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act 1957 defines a contract of sale of goods, a contract that allows the seller to transfer, or agree to  transfer the rights of a product to a buyer in return for payment of the price quoted.  29   The basic elements of the contract are offer, acceptance, consideration, intention, certainty and ability.  30  Section 12 (2) Sale of Goods Act 1957 defines the conditions as to the principal provisions of the basic purposes of a breach of  contract and raise the right to consider the contract to be canceled.  31  Warranty is ancillary to the fundamental purpose of the provisions of a contract and breach of the right to claim compensation  poses only and is not a cancellation of the contract as per section 12 (3) Sale of Goods Act 1957.   75 Mustafa â€˜Afi fi  bin Ab. Halim et al. /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  121 ( 2014 )  68 â€“ 78  implied condition on the goods being sold must adhere to the descriptive given by the seller 32 , the quality  can be traded and appropriate with meaning deemed proper to the buyer 33 , and the sample that is precise  from the quality aspect of goods being sold 34 .  The government is conscientious in constructing for a new formulation to upgrade efforts on the  protection of consumer rights. This is reflected through the establishment of Consumer Protection Act  1999 (Act 599) which provides for additional legal frameworks to monitor consumer rights on the issue  of supply of goods against the suppliers or manufactures of the goods concerned. Act 599 contains 14  parts involving 150 legal provisions to for consumer protection, the setting up of National Consumer  Advisory Council and Consumer Claims Tribunal.  Apart from that, under the 599 Act, the use of a new  term â€“ guarantee 35  was inserted to highlight the seriousness of a guarantee default in supplying and  manufacturing of goods to consumer among others, detailing the level of guarantee default as a minor  default that could be rectified, or involving a substantial default.  The establishment of Standard Halal Malaysia (MS 1500:2004), the application of ISO/IEC Guide 65  guidelines, and Malaysia Halal Certification Procedure Manual, are proofs of Malaysiaâ€™s commitment on  the handling and management of halal products. These standard, guidelines, and manual have the  potential for utilization as terms of references by other countries (Wan Mohamad, 2010:1). Halal  standards in Malaysia are developed through consensus by committees which comprised balanced  representation of producers, users, consumers and others with relevant interest 36 . Approval of a standard  as a Malaysian standard is governed by the Standards of Malaysian Act 1996 37 .  In the management of Halal Certification of JAKIM and JAIN, various laws and acts below are  applicable:  1. The Trade Descriptions Act (TDA) 2011, Trade Descriptions (Definition of Halal) Order 2011,  and Trade Descriptions (Certification and Marking of Halal) Order 2011 state the definition of halal and  halal food preparation in accordance to the sharia law together with the offences of falsification of raw  materials and halal documentation enforced by the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and  Consumerism (MDTCC);    2.

While the  manufacturer liability detailed in section 50 (a) to (d), among others, in relation to a breach of the implied guarantee compliance  with acceptable quality, description of goods, repairs and spare parts and breach of manufacturer clear guarantees (refer to section  38 of Act 599).  36  Mustafa â€˜Afifi Ab.

Covered by tissue fluid, surface of these anatomies tend to be glossy, showing specular reflections from the illumination  source. In this paper, we present a novel method for specular region separation and restoration from only a single image. Distin- guishing from segmentation methods using simple threshold, our solution treats the separation of highlight pixels as a binariza- tion problem based upon a supervised learning classification algorithm. Also, we propose a multiscale dynamic image expansion  and fusion based method to restore the highlighted region. It takes full advantages of propagating the regions with similar struc- ture features to specular regions. Experimental results on the removal of the endoscopic image with specular reflections demon- strate improved efficiency by the proposed method compared to commonly used techniques.    Keywords: Endoscopic images; specular highlight separation; SVM classification; concealment of specular reflections; image restoration.  1. Introduction  Endoscopic imaging provides close observation in very demanding clinical practice to minimize unrecoverable  invasion to patientsâ€™ physical conditions caused by conventional surgical approaches. Needless to damage organs  and tissues, postoperative recovery time and mortality rate can significantly reduce by using vision based techniques.  As a result of minimized invasion, clarity of imaging in a resilient, highly scattering internal environment of human  body is recently addressed to the success of lesion detection and therapeutic procedures. An endoscope is usually  composed with a micro camera and an unpolarized illumination source both close to the tip region. Unfortunately,  the surfaces of the mucosa inside human organs feature a glossy appearance due to specular reflection of the light  sources. Not only these specular spots damage image quality from diagnostic point of view1, these distinct, bright  763 Yefei Gao et al. /  Procedia Computer Science  107 ( 2017 )  762 â€“ 767  features can also become a direct source of error for many visual analysis algorithms such as segmentation, object  recognition, shape reconstruction from shading etc.1.  A good number of studies were conducted aiming to detect and remove specular reflections on the endoscopy im- ages in medical and industrial applications. Stehle2 selected the brightest peak of the Y channel in the YUV color  space histogram as a threshold to segment the specular regions. Arnold3 studied a segmentation method of specular  reflections based on nonlinear filtering and color image thresholding. Karapetyan4 constructed multiple sliding win- dows with predefined sizes and the threshold for each window in their approach can be adapted according to the  histogram of the analyzed image. The work proposed by Silva Da Queiroz, et al.5 achieved a precise specular detec- tion based on sparse and low-rank decomposition of the endoscopic images. Samar M6 combined saturation and col- our intensity attributes with a wavelet based edges projection for specular highlights detection. In terms of specular  region restoration, Saint-Pierre7 achieved inpainting by performing a homogenous diffusion inward from the sides of  the specular region. Arnold, et al.3 used color balance ratio and a filling technique based on the centroid color of the  pixels within a specified distance. In Karapetyanâ€™s4 work, a frequency selective extrapolation algorithm was used to  define a suboptimal size of the support area for image restoration. All these methods worked as anticipated under  certain conditions yet precision of specular separation and vividness after inpainting remain to be improved. Aiming  at possible improvement, we propose: (a) a SVM-based specular separation method, (b) a robust dynamic expanding  searching strategy and image fusing based highlight removal method.  The paper is organized as follows: section 2 and 3 introduced the proposed segmentation and elimination methods  of specular regions. An evaluation section is followed by to compare the performance of our method on sample im- ages against two chosen methods, along with some conclusive remarks in the end section of this paper.  2. The proposed highlight separation method  Unlike common specular region separation based on statistical approach and thresholding, we propose to solve  the segmentation issue as a binary classification problem and solve it with SVM learning algorithm in which we  avoid selecting a threshold manually. By training the model with sample images, a robust and accurate separation  model can be obtained. Here follows the details.  2.1. Pixel-wise feature construction  The specular regions of a contaminated endoscopic image can be primarily characterized to be overly exposed yet  under saturated. Also, there is no independent channel either in RGB or HSV color spaces that can differentiate the  specular regions from unaffected pixels inside an image. Thus to increase the saliency contrast and obtain an feature  descriptor that represents specular attribute, we define the saliency measure D, the saturation measure M, and the  intensity ratio Q which was proposed by Shen8, which are summarized in (1).  2(1 ) ( )  Â­Â°  Â˜  Â®Â°    Â¯ dark range maxmax max min D I S M BVal S Q I II I I              (1)  where darkI  is the dark channel in RGB colour space and can be described in { , , }r g bmin I I I . BVal refers to the pixel  value of the blue channel and S represents saturation channel in HSV colour space. maxI denotes { , , }r g bmax I I I . It  can be observed that the measures of D, Q and M taken from a typical endoscope image have a strong distinction  between specular and normal pixels. These features are then combined with the intensity value V and the saturation  value S as the pixel-wise feature of our segmentation method. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed feature for  image enhancement, we compared the average value of pixels inside specular and normal regions by defining  EnhVal as following way which represents the difference of specular and normal pixel.   S NEnhVal F F          (2)  764   Yefei Gao et al. /  Procedia Computer Science  107 ( 2017 )  762 â€“ 767  where SF  and NF donate the mean value of feature F of specular and normal regions respectively. EnhVal values of  different features are presented in table 1 which shows obvious advantages of the proposed feature D, M.  Table 1. EnhVal of different features.  Feature V S D M Q8  EnhVal 1.3688 2.8267 26.0382 27.5766 7.2479  2.2. Structure-wise feature construction  Intuitively, specular regions are considered as missing details and can no longer represent original texture. How- ever, boundary of specular regions is distinctive in intensity gradient. Thus we calculate the modified gradient fea- ture of an image by morphological operation after solving the gradient.  2 2 = ( ( )) ( , ) ( , ) ( , )   Â­ Â�Â°Â°  Â˜Â®Â°    Â°Â¯ G p min x y x MG MGI MGI Morp I grad DI grad G x y G x y G x y                               (3)  where DI donates the specular endoscopic image, MGI indicates the modified gradient image of DI. MG is the modi- fied gradient feature at pixel p of DI. Grad and Morp donate the gradient and morphological operation; ( , )G x y ,  ( , )xG x y  and ( , )yG x y  represent the gradient value at pixel ( , )p x y  and its components in x and y direction respec- tively.   b c d e f ga Fig.1. (a) origin specular image; (b-g) intensity of feature maps represent V, S, D, M, Q, MG respectively.  Therefore, by combining pixel-wise and modified gradient feature, the combined feature descriptor of a pixel p  can be formulated as { , , , , , }F S V D M Q Gp p p p p p px x x x x x x . Then we trained the SVM model C for specular pixel separation  with feature descriptor Fpx and its highlight label l of pixel p.  3. Multiscale dynamic searching and structure similarity based inpainting method  After specular separation, the specular regions will be dealt using image inpainting method. It is composed by a  dynamic expanding searching and image fusing strategies to find out the image blocks with the highest similarity in  structure feature.   3.1. Location and size of candidate damaged block  To take full advantages of regions with similar structure to restore the specular pixels, we propose a multiscale  expanding strategy for deciding the specular block to eliminate. This method enables the specular block to enrich  structure features and further guarantee the validity of the inpainting method based on structural similarity. The can- didate specular blocks to be restored should satisfy the following condition:  ( ) / ( ) E : :  !DBN DBR PixNum DBN PixNum DB        (4)  765 Yefei Gao et al. /  Procedia Computer Science  107 ( 2017 )  762 â€“ 767  where DB donates the damaged block to restore and DBN represents the normal part of DB, :DBN and:DB measure  the of DB and DBN respectively. PixNum is a function that computes the actual pixel number inside an area and E is  a preset threshold.  3.2. Selection of seed point for candidate blocks  The candidate blocks are selected according to the following assumption that regions with shorter geometric dis- tance to the specular spots are more similar in structure. Thus, to select seed points of candidate blocks, we design a  selection strategy that is centralized to specular pixel and the number of seed points decays with a Gaussian distribu- tion along its normal directions. The method for seed point generation is based on the fundamental condition that if  random variables X and Y satisfy Gaussian distribution and are independent to each other, the joint probability dis- tribution complies with two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and we have:  1 1 2 2( , ),   ( , ),   ( , )P V P VSeed SeedSeedPos X Y X N Y N        (5)  where SeedPos is a seed point set, SeedX and SeedY are the coordinates of seed point positions that are subjected to two  independent Gaussian distributions parameterized separately as 1 1( , )P V  and 2 2( , )P V . This guarantee that more can- didate blocks exist near the specular pixel will be selected for inpainting process.  3.3. Location of candidate blocks for inpainting process and the specular removal strategy  To find the candidate regions for restoring the specular regions, we propose the following selection strategy de- scribed in (6).  { ( , )} CBS Sort SIM NCB NDB         (6)  where CBS is the candidate block sequence selected by the proposed seed points searching method. NDB and NCB  are the normal parts of damaged and candidate blocks respectively. SIM is the selected function of structural similar- ity measure and Sort denotes a sort function. We consider the EHD proposed by Buzug9 as the structure similarity  measure for selecting the candidate blocks considering its simple calculation and high efficiency. Then restoration to  the specular pixels inside highlight blocks can be initiated with the weighted sum value of candidate blocks. To  avoid artefacts produced by overly inpainting, we fuse the restored and original image using a gradually decay  weighting template to smoothen the inpainting result.  1 1 1 1 1( , ) ( , ), ( ) (1 ) ( )Ëˆ   Â­  Â�Â°Â®Â°  Â˜     Â˜  Â¯ Â¦N k k k p i j q i j q CBS k N IB w CB w DB w Gaussian BlockMask                (7)  where ( , )p i j represents the restored pixel. N is the number of candidate blocks and ( , )kq i j donates the pixel value  of the kth candidate block and the pixel value at the corresponding position of ( , )p i j . IB is the image after fusing  operation and CB donates the restored block. 1w is the fusion weight obtained by applying a gaussian filter to the  binary template noted as BlockMask.  4. Experimental results  The proposed SVM model for specular separation was trained on 55 images with specular spots from CVC- ColonDB10, a database of annotated video sequences of colonoscopy video. A feature descriptor ( , )i j\ with dimen- sion of (9Ã—6) including V, S, D, Q, M and MG was calculated using (8):  766   Yefei Gao et al. /  Procedia Computer Science  107 ( 2017 )  762 â€“ 767  ( , ) ( -1, -1) ( -1, ) ( +1, ) ( , -1) ( , ) ( , +1) ( +1, -1) ( +1, ) ( +1, +1)={ , , , , , , , , ,}  { , , , , , }Ëˆ\ M M M M M M M M M MÂ�i j i j i j i j i j i j i j i j i j i j V S D M Q MG        (8)  where ( , )i jM donates a 6-dimension feature vector at ( , )p i j .  Fig.2 (c) and (d) are the evaluation results using an existing technique based on Arnoldâ€™s method and our specular  separation method. The blue and black curves in Fig.2 (e) demonstrate how separation accuracy and support vector  of proposed model vary as the number of sample was increased. It can be observed that a rapid rise in accuracy to  about 97% was obtained even though the number of samples used is relatively small. Over the range of sample  quantity from 3000 to 10000, the separation accuracy continued raising until reaching a peak level around 98.5%.  Then increase in the sample number no longer brought about better performance in specular separation. After a drop  of 2%, the separation accuracy started increasing again but at a much slower speed. The drop may cause by the lack  of gold standard of highlight separation result especially on the border of specular regions, so it may bring a steep  drop of accuracy when test a poor sample. The strength of the proposed specular separation method is learning- based algorithm that can automatically class a pixel as specular one or not without the need for threshold setting.     b c da e Fig.2.

Experiment results of the proposed specular concealment method. (a) original image; (b) concealed image with the method in Saint-Pierre7;  (c) concealed image with the proposed method; (d) intensity gradient before concealment; (e) intensity gradient after concealment.  Another set of specular removal and restoration results from Saint-Pierre7 and our methods are presented in Fig.3  (b) and (c), and the specular regions highlighted in the gradient map of Fig.3 (d) are effectively removed by both  techniques. See the resultant gradient maps of Fig.3 (e). Noticeably, in Saint-Pierre method, the colour attribute of  pixels surrounding the specular regions were used to propagate the restoration. The performance of their work is  acceptable if the area of the specular region is small. When it comes to a large piece to be restored, the colour in  specular regions might seem homologous and a noticeable artefact may appear. Our solution compensates the ad- dressed issue by propagating the restoration when a match between the selected feature structure of a sequence of  blocks and that of the specular regions is found.   Furthermore, Coefficient of Variation (COV)11 was applied to make a quantitatively evaluate our inpainting meth- od and is defined to be:  V P X XCOV        (9)  whereV X and PX represent the standard deviation and mean of the restored region.

Specular Reflectance Suppression in Endoscopic Imagery via Stochastic Bayesian EBeijing Engineering Research Center of Mixed Reality and Advanced Display, School of Optics and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, ChinaEndoscopic imaging is a common clinical modality to inspect surficial abnormality grew on the internal organs inside human body. Covered by tissue fluid, surface of these anatomies tend to be glossy, showing specular reflections from the illumination source. In this paper, we present a novel method for specular region separation and restoration from only a single image. Distinguishing from segmentation methods using simple threshold, our solution treats the separation of highlight pixels as a binarization problem based upon a supervised learning classification algorithm. Also, we propose a multiscale dynamic image expansion and fusion based method to restore the highlighted region. It takes full advantages of propagating the regions with similar structure features to specular regions. Experimental results on the removal of the endoscopic image with specular reflections demonstrate improved efficiency by the proposed method compared to commonly used techniques.Vogt F, Paulus D, Heigl B, Vogelgsang C, Niemann H, Greiner G, Schick C.

Peer-review under responsibility of Road and Bridge Research Institute (IBDiM). 1. Introduction Our contribution came about as a result of two remarkable factors: First we noticed the lack of available  knowledge about  the daily mobility habits of people with disabilities; then we observed the special case of people  with mental, psychological and cognitive disabilities who are even less well studied as their disabilities are invisible.  According to Laurent Saby (2012) a mental disability can be defined as the result of a developmental disability. It  can be considered as a more limited capacity for learning linked to a significantly below average intellectual  development. It results in difficulties more or less severe in areas of reflection, conceptualization, communication  and decision making. A cognitive disability is the result of cognitive dysfunctions. These troubles are linked to attention, memory,  adaptation to change, language, perceptual (gnosies) and gestual (praxis) identifications. A cognitive disability  implies no particular intellectual impairment only difficulties in mobilizing capabilities. A psychological disability is the result of psychological blocking factors. Like the cognitive disability,  a psychological disability is not linked with an intellectual disability. It is characterized by an alternating calm or  tense mental state and by difficulties in acquiring or expressing psychosocial skills. A lack of attention and some  difficulties to plan and follow activity programs can occur. A psychological disability often leads to anxiety and  relational and communication difficulties. The French Act of 11 February 2005 on equal rights and opportunities, participation and citizenship of people  with disabilities highlights the need ""for people with disabilities or reduced mobility"" to have access to the complete  mobility chain. This law was initially planned to apply from 2015 but a maximum 9 year extension has been given to  local authorities on the condition that they list and promise to carry out all the listed improvements. Many efforts  have been made to improve travel situations for people with physical, visual and, to a lesser extent, hearing  disabilities. But there is still great room for improvement for situations involving those with psychological, cognitive  and mental disabilities. This is largely due to the lack of knowledge of precise difficulties experienced by those  people with the aforementioned disabilities. Our research began thanks to the city of Amiens which was expecting  specific recommendations issued by the French state services. This paper is divided into five sections. Following this introduction, we then discuss, in the second section, how  the mobility of people with mental, cognitive or psychic troubles may be taken into account in French quantitative  surveys. Information has been gathered both from the already available mobility and disability surveys. The third  section explores the literature on the â€˜commented walkâ€™ methodology. The fourth section presents our own  methodological choices and the difficulties we have faced. Finally, the fifth section lists the benefits of this method.  The conclusion advocates a formalization and an implementation of this methodological process. Â© 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Overview of available datas In France, various surveys are used to study the daily mobility of people with disabilities. At national level, two  sorts of surveys bring us this information: those focusing on mobility and those focusing on disability. Since the late 60s, five national mobility surveys have been conducted by INSEE and the department of Transport  (1966-67, 1973-74, 1981-82, 1993-94 and 2007- 08). These surveys are the largest mobility surveys in France, with  a sample size of 20,000 households, and consider all trips irrespective of their purpose, length, duration, transport  mode, or the period of year or time of day. They allow the precise study of peopleâ€™s daily mobility in terms of for  example the number of trips, distances, duration, means of transport and purpose. However, only the following question appears in the questionnaire: ""(NAME) is he/she physically limited or  limited in their journey away from home (regardless of the means of transport used)?"". Although this question allows  us to identify people with disabilities it does not allow us to accurately detect those with mental or cognitive  disabilities. Regarding disability, two surveys have been conducted by INSEE since the late 90s: the â€œHandicap IncapacitÃ©  DÃ©pendanceâ€� (Handicap Disability Dependancy survey -1999) and â€œHandicap SantÃ©â€� (Disability healthcare survey - 2007). Unlike previous surveys, they enable us to observe accurately peopleâ€™s impairments and disabilities and  therefore to detect people with cognitive or mental disabilities. We can find in their questionnaires some information  about their mobility and their difficulties with accessibility. For example, time spent at home and if traveling the  difficult places to access. However, the quantitative approaches used to obtain representative analyzes of the general population in France  and to establish a causal link between the socioeconomic variables and situations of disability or mobility behavior  are limited. Firstly, the entire chain of travel canâ€™t be studied and secondly the specific difficulties faced by  individuals and their causes are not stated. Thus, in addition to these quantitative approaches, some qualitative  approaches are needed to obtain a thorough comprehensive analysis.  Semi-structured interviews combined with participant observations (Rissera, Iwarssonb, StÃ¥hlc, 2012) as well as  focus group interviews and expert interviews (Rosenkvist, 2008) have already been performed abroad by researchers  interested in people with cognitive functional limitations (MAPLE consortium, 2003 ; Barham, 2005). In France,  only a few works have been conducted, especially by state services (Charzat, 2002 ; Dejeammes, 2006). They are  mostly based on quantitative datas issued from the â€œHandicap IncapacitÃ© DÃ©pendanceâ€� survey (Roussel, 2006) and  sometimes on expert interviews (Alauzet, Conte, Sanchez, Velche, 2010). As for us, we used a new methodology  called â€œcommented walkâ€�. 3. The â€žcommented walksâ€� methodology A qualitative methodology called 'commented walks' (Thibaud, 2001) used by urbanists to investigate the quality  of urban environment using either photos or videos. This method was popularized in France, by the Research Center  on Sonic space & Urban environment (CRESSON research laboratory - School of Architecture of Grenoble). It  relies on the ""thinking aloud"" technique devised by Alan Newell and Herbert Simon (1972) in the US. Â«This is a  journey with a real-time storytellingÂ» (Miaux, 2008). That is to say, the researcher follows the interviewed person  while they are interacting with several other players (e.g. bystanders) and objects (e.g. urban furniture...)  which they  may encounter on their route. While walking the interviewed person verbalizes what they are doing and what they are thinking. On the road, the  researcher gets a subjective point of view. (Petiteau, Pasquier, 2001). The interviewed person talks about the  incidents taking place during the walk (Miaux, 2008). A cameraman tries to catch reflective pauses, paces,  movement variations or noticeable emotional changes. Although it may seem artificial to ask someone to verbalize  their action, thanks to unpredictable and random urban phenomena, people behave relatively naturally. The ""commented walks"" methodology leads to a very precise analysis of mobility choices process. For example,  Sophie Pene (1999) narrates the tactics of a person in a hurry to leave her workplace. ""The run starts at the door of  the office. If the elevator fails then she rushes down the stairs. If a group of chatty colleagues stays in the lobby, she  makes a detour to avoid chatting ; if there is a performance on the square, she chooses the underground, if the queue  at the ticket office is too long, she opts for the automatic teller..."" (Pene, 1999) 4406   JoÃ«l Meissonnier and Virginie Dejoux /  Transportation Research Procedia  14 ( 2016 )  4403 â€“ 4409  We were looking for a method to give us a better understanding of mobility behaviours, especially with people  with disabilities. We were also looking more precisely for a method suitable for participnats with verbal or non  structured  verbal difficulties. So, we carried out 4 'commented walks' in the city of Amiens in order to test the  methodology: x Marie and Etienne have trisomy 21. x Fabien has an intellectual disability; he is illiterate but knows how to read figures. x Marion has a dyspraxia. As the goal is for us to study mobility in urban environments we have adapted the methodological protocol  according to Chevrier and Juguet's advices. For sure, the learned skills coming from the experience of a routine  route is of great interest. But the unfamiliarity of a path leads people to draw on their former experiences, which is  very interesting too. As Marie, Fabien and Marion seemed relatively autonomous on public transport, we asked  them to add slight challenges. x In the morning Marie was going to her workplace with her father by car. She was returning alone, by bus. We  suggested she tried an outward journey by public transport for the first time. x Fabien seemed really capable of dealing with public transport in his daily routine. So we asked him to go to the  zoo, a place he was not familiar with. x Marion has excellent communication skills. One day she got lost in Amiens, so we asked her to try to find the  path she had taken that day. According to Chevrier & Juguetâ€™s work (2003), such a script is an in situ test. It aims to ask the traveler to face  realistically a set of situations which forces them to adjust their action plans. Typically, people in public transport  run on autopilot. Guided by their habits, they follow some procedures without questioning their practices. These  practices become automatic. Indeed our films show clearly that a fictitious situation causes a break in the routine  action chain. And they show how people face more unexpected events and less known routes. In short, our aim was to test a method originally designed to study the urban environment through mobility then  to adapt it in order to study the daily mobility of people with a less structured verbal expression in the  unpredictability of an urban context. 4. Our survey in Amiens The survey was conducted in Amiens (France) in 2012. A 'commented walk' must be prepared in advance. First,  the researcher has to hire a cameraman. A technical solution must be found to record on the video everything the  person says; even if this person is walking 20 or 30 meters ahead the cameraman.  Then the survey preparation usually focuses on: x The recruitment of interviewed volunteers x The presentation of the purpose of the survey. x The explanation of the survey protocol. x The necessity to make oneself available for half a day long. x The presence of a camera. On the chosen day the first half-an-hour is usually spent teaching the interviewee how to ""think aloud"". Then the  journey can begin. Due to the presence of people with disabilities, it took us more time: x to reach them (thanks to local authorities we managed to reach local parents associations; thanks to a local foster  home we also managed to reach some people). x to explain the investigation process to the interviewee. x to reassure these interviewees. 4407 JoÃ«l Meissonnier and Virginie Dejoux /  Transportation Research Procedia  14 ( 2016 )  4403 â€“ 4409  x to precisely inform parents of minors and adult's guardians. x to obtain from the guardianship judge the appropriate authorization to record. On D-Day, the interview began on the routine route (to work or to school). No hardships were suggested at the  beginning. They only came afterwards when the interviewee seemed capable enough to  deal with them. Definitive results coming from the â€˜commented walksâ€™ methodology are not based on a representative sample.  The main quality of this method is illustrative; and this quality isn't anecdotal. It is complementary to quantitative  methods which: x doesnâ€™t assess how much both public transport and public areas induce some difficulties or not. x doesnâ€™t precisely identify these difficulties. In fact, our method manages to explain what those difficulties are for people with mental, cognitive or  psychological disabilities. Thatâ€™s the reason why we think it may be useful to complete quantitative approaches and  to point out the difficulties encountered by people with disabilities in urban spaces. 5. Results 5.1. An information discontinuity During her route, Marion hesitates. The video shows her struggling to know where she is. She says: ""there were  no road works there the last time."" An impromptu event disrupts the routine route and is often problematic. For  example, a situation involving road works or any unpredictable situation which requires people to find an unfamiliar  path (need for bypasses) requires some urban arrangements. If a path made from stickers pasted on the ground may  seem childish, it is especially appreciated by people with disabilities in these circumstances. Usually when Marie returns from work by bus No. 9 and arrives in the downtown interchange bus station of  Amiens, she gets off the bus at a stop located near a pedestrian crossing. As she was trying the outward journey by  public transport for the first time she placed herself on the other side of the pedestrian crossing. Indeed this is how  she had been taught to catch a bus going in the opposite direction. Therefore, she was trying to apply a rule that told   her to wait on the other side of the street in order to catch it. But this rule does not work in such an interchange  station. On the video, Marie is seen waiting with other passersby at the pedestrian crossing. When bus No. 9 passed it  didnâ€™t stop. We helped her to find the right bus stop. However, the line was split into two directions along the route  and in order to get the right bus it was necessary to know the buses final destination. Another problem for Marie was  that she couldnâ€™t know the final destination because she had arrived from the back of the bus where there was only  the bus number on display. In both situations, Marie tried to carefully follow the rules but she failed in her task due to break downs in the  information chain. These examples show that both the continuity of the information chain and the standardization of  the displayed information are important. 5.2. Disruptive cognitive attractors The video shows that Marion was unable to recognize a crossroads that she had already passed by for the third  time. This can be explained by the fact that she arrived from three different directions. But the film also shows that  the presence of advertisements on the road contributed to her confusion as they distracted her from looking for  relevant information. Basically, situations of mental, cognitive and psychic disabilities do not require their own new language of  communication. They require more consistency and seamless continuity in languages that already exist. It is  necessary to better highlight the informational devices. Concretely, that means minimize - and in some contexts such  as an interchange station eradicate - messages that might 'pollute' the relevant information (advertising, illuminated  signs that divert the focus of attention...). 4408   JoÃ«l Meissonnier and Virginie Dejoux /  Transportation Research Procedia  14 ( 2016 )  4403 â€“ 4409  According to Gibson (1977), public space is full of 'affordances'. These signs can either relieve the perceptual  activity of the user (i.e.: function of directional signage), or invite him to perform a particular action that he was not  thinking of doing (i.e.: the trash bin invites us to throw away, the public mailbox reminds us to post a letter...). Our  videos show that the â€˜affordancesâ€™ may also become some highly disruptive cognitive attractors (Chevrier, Juguet,  2003 ; Denis, Pontille 2008 ; 2010). 5.3. Too complex cognitive procedures to reach a destination The video shows Marion saying she particularly appreciates the pictures of major buildings or places on the city  maps: ""Without that, it's not even worth trying to read the map"". In fact  Marion doesn't bother with city maps  because for her, most of the city maps require too many complex cognitive procedures to reach a destination. She tried to explain to us that the locations of city maps are badly placed. Usually located on the back of  advertising hoardings, these geocentric local maps should permit a simple cognitive projection on the ground with  north directly in front of the user thereby no longer requiring an additional cognitive operation such as turning in  order to face north. 5.4. Human assistance : some needs for trainings Fabien is illiterate. He has an excellent relationship with the staff of the transport company of Amiens. He talks to  the drivers and is able to put questions to anyone wearing a uniform. We suggested he changed his usual route to get  to the zoo. In Amiensâ€™s main interchange bus station, Fabien spontaneously questioned an employee of the transport  company. The employee advised Fabien to take bus No. 1 to get to the zoo. Unfortunately he didnâ€™t think of  indicating either the right direction and final destination or the location of the bus stop. This employee was probably  lacking training.  This was also a problem for Marie when she realized her mistake in taking the wrong No. 9 bus. She asked for the  driverâ€™s help. The driver answered that ""As a rule, every other bus should go to Zone Industrielle (her final  destination)â€�. Therefore, the driver should have told her to get off the bus and wait for the next one. But the driver  failed to do this possibly due to a lack of training. Human assistance must remain a priority because it is often difficult to replace it with any technological  alternatives. People with disabilities especially rely on men and women in uniform (employees of public transport,  police, doctors...). They see them as resources. But in France these employees are not always aware of their  importance to the public. This discrepancy emphasizes the great need for increased training for these employees. 6. Conclusions Our findings come from a qualitative methodology aiming to complement quantitative approaches. Indeed,  quantitative approaches are not able to go further than the concept of 'difficulty'. Furthermore they are inadequate  when describing the precise problems faced by people with mental, cognitive or psychological disabilities. We have  adapted the ""commented walks"" methodology originally designed to analyze urban environments. We used that methodology to understand how people with disabilities behave in public spaces while commuting  daily. We also adapted that methodology in order to understand how people manage when traveling to less familiar  destinations. The main recommendations from our research are: x need for a coherent and foolproof continuity of informational systems (staking, numbering of buildings in the  street, bus destination displays...) x necessity to minimize the 'affordances' that may become highly disruptive cognitive attractors (i.e. advertising,  illuminated signs that divert the focus of attention ...). x need for a simplification and systematization of cognitive procedures to reach a destination. x need for staff training: human assistance remains essential and can't always be replaced by a device. 4409 JoÃ«l Meissonnier and Virginie Dejoux /  Transportation Research Procedia  14 ( 2016 )  4403 â€“ 4409  Our results reveal the effectiveness of the ""commented walks"" methodology which could be more formally  introduced in order to explore in each city the reality and the details of the problems encountered by people with  disabilities. This method seems especially relevant for people with difficulties of expression because their behavior  can be just as meaningful as language in describing their problems. Furthermore this methodology produces videos  that can be use to convince local authorities of the necessity to include people with less visible disabilities. Finally,  videos can also contribute to staff training. For example, they are useful in teaching employees working in public  transport: both those in the front line dealing with customers and those who design transport networks.

s2405601415004940.xml,"Recent top physics highlights at the LHC   Tancredi Carli CERN, Route de Meyrin, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland On behalf of the ATLAS and CMS collaborations Abstract Recent highlights of measurements by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations involving top quarks produced at the LHC are presented. Emphasis is put on precise inclusive and diï¬€erential top pair production cross section measure- ments and comparisons to QCD calculations. Special attention is given to ï¬�ducial measurements. Results on elec- troweak single top quarks production and the recent evidence of top pair produced in associated with vector bosons are summarised. The experimental status of top quark mass measurements is critically reviewed. Keywords: LHC, QCD, NNLO, Top Quark, Monte Carlo simulation 1. Introduction The large hadron collider LHC at CERN has deliv- ered proton-proton (pp) collisions with an integrated luminosity of 5 fbâˆ’1 at a centre-of-mass energy ofâˆš s=7 TeV and 20 fbâˆ’1 at âˆš s=8 TeV. This large data set together with the excellent detector performance al- lowed to make several high precision measurements and to test rare processes. This note reports on the excellent progress made this and last year using the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] detec- tors. On the experimental side new ideas to reduce ex- perimental uncertainties have been put in action. New kinematic regions like high transverse momenta or high jet multiplicities are explored. On the theory side an unprecedented precision has been reached for ï¬�xed or- der calculations and new concepts to build Monte Carlo generators are developed. Detailed tests and searches for particles and interac- tions beyond the Standard Model coupling to top quarks are reported elsewhere.  Talk given at the 37th ICHEP conference, July 2014, Valencia, Spain. Email address: tancredi.carli@cern.ch (Tancredi Carli) 2. Top pair cross section at NNLO accuracy The calculation of the top quark pair (ttÂ¯) cross sec- tion has recently been completed to exact next-to-next- to-leading (NNLO) QCD accuracy. This is the culmi- nation point of long standing theoretical eï¬€orts on ï¬�xed order QCD calculations [3â€“8]. After the ï¬�rst next-to- leading (NLO) QCD [9, 10] results in 1988, the ad- dition of next-to-leading-logarithm (NLL) [11â€“16] and of next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) in 2009 [3, 17, 18], the exact NNLO result was published in 2013 [8]. The NNLO+NNLL ttÂ¯ cross section for pp collisions at âˆš s=7 TeV is ÏƒttÂ¯ = 177+10âˆ’11 pb and at âˆš s=8 TeV is ÏƒttÂ¯ = 253+13âˆ’15 pb for a top quark mass (mt) of 172.5 GeV. These values are calculated with the top++2.0 pro- gram [19]. The systematic uncertainty includes the PDF4LHC prescription [20] for the proton parton den- sity function (PDF) and the strong coupling Î±S uncer- tainties using the MSTW2008 68% CL NNLO [21, 22] CT10 NNLO [23, 24] and NNPDF2.3 5f FFN [25] PDF sets, added in quadrature to the renormalisation and fac- torisation scale uncertainty. The NLO corrections increase the ttÂ¯ cross section by about 10%, and the NNLO+NNLL corrections give a further rise of similar size. The accuracy of the cal- culation improves from about 12% at NLO to 3% at Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Nuclear and Particle Physics Proceedings 273â€“275 (2016) 29â€“42 2405-6014/Â© 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. www.elsevier.com/locate/nppp http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2015.09.005 This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). NNLO+NNLL due to the renormalisation and factori- sation scale and from 8% to 5% due to the PDF. With the improved precision due to the NNLO calculation the uncertainties on the PDFs dominate. In proton anti-proton (ppÂ¯) collisions at âˆš s=1.96 TeV at Tevatron the fraction of gluon-induced processes Ïƒgg/Ïƒtot to the total ttÂ¯ cross section is about 15%, while in pp collisions at LHC it is about 85% at âˆš s=7 TeV. 3. Inclusive t tÂ¯ cross section measurements ATLAS has recently published a measurement of the inclusive ttÂ¯ cross section in the dilepton channel for the full data set at âˆš s=7 TeV and âˆš s=8 TeV [26]. The novel feature of this analysis is that the ttÂ¯ selection is only based on leptons. By only requiring one electron and one muon with pT > 25 GeV and |Î·| < 2.5 a pure sample of ttÂ¯ events can be selected. The cross section is measured from the b-jet multiplicity distribution by ï¬�tting simultaneously ÏƒttÂ¯ and a factor that parametrises the b-jet tagging eï¬ƒciency and acceptance  b. For more than one b-jets the sample is largely dominated by ttÂ¯ events. The total number of ttÂ¯ events is 33405 with a background fraction of about 10%. The total inclusive ttÂ¯ cross section is measured to be: 182.9Â±3.1(stat.)Â±4.2(syst.)Â±3.6(lumi.) pb atâˆšs = 7 TeV 242.4Â±1.7(stat.)Â±5.5(syst.)Â±3.6(lumi.) pb atâˆšs = 8 TeV. The precision of this measurement is 3-4%. The de- tailed breakdown of the main uncertainties is sum- marised in Table 1. The main systematic uncertainty is due to the knowledge of the luminosity of the data set. A simultaneous measurement at âˆš s=7 TeV [27] of the inclusive ttÂ¯,WW and the Z â†’ Ï„Ï„ cross section sepa- rating the processes using the jet multiplicity (Njet) and the missing transverse momentum (ET,miss) gives: 181.2Â±2.8(stat.)Â±9.6(syst.)Â±3.3(lumi.) pb atâˆšs = 7 TeV. This measurement exploits that ttÂ¯ processes have high ET,miss and high Njet, while the Z â†’ Ï„Ï„ production has low ET,miss and Njet and the WW process is in between. Also a ï¬�ducial measurement is provided resulting in a reduction of the PDF uncertainty. For comparisons of this measurement with theory prediction an additional uncertainty due to the LHC beam energy (0.6%) needs to be considered which in- duces an uncertainty on the ttÂ¯ cross section of 4.2 pb (1.8%).

At âˆš s=8 TeV the ATLAS and CMS measurements are in good agreement with each other and with the NNLO+NNLL QCD prediction. At âˆš s=7 TeV there is a tension of about two standard deviations (Ïƒ). A recent ttÂ¯ cross section combination of the Tevatron experiments [30] gives 7.6Â±0.2(stat.)Â±0.29(syst.)Â±0.21(lumi.) pb atâˆšs = 1.96 TeV. The precision of the Tevatron and LHC measurements is compared in Table 2. At Tevatron (LHC) a preci- sion of 6â€“7% (4-6%) is achieved. At both colliders the largest uncertainty is due the luminosity. At CDF this is mitigated using inclusive Z boson production as ref- erence. Fig. 1 shows a summary of recent ttÂ¯ cross sec- tion measurements at Tevatron and LHC compared to NNLO+NNLL QCD. Overall an impressive experimental precision is ac- complished by both Tevatron and LHC measurements. The experimental precision matches well the precision reached by the NNLO+NNLL QCD calculation.

Top pair ï¬�nal state modelling Over the past 20 years signiï¬�cant progress has been made in the ï¬�nal state modelling of high energetic parti- cle collisions using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation gen- erators [31]. In particular for measurements of ï¬�nal state with top quarks this is important since many preci- sion measurement are limited by systematic uncertain- ties on MC modelling and moreover ttÂ¯ event represent an important background for new physics searches. Around 1990 the ï¬�rst MC generators (Pythia [32], Herwig [33]) became available where the hard scatter- ing was based on a LO matrix element (ME) for 2â†’2 processes interfaced with parton showers (PS) describ- ing the additional radiation to leading logarithm accu- racy ME(2â†’2)@LO+PS. Also the transition of partons to the observable hadrons was modelled. In 2001 MCs were able to merge leading order matrix elements for 2â†’n with up to n=5 partons in the hard scattering processes including a matching procedure to parton showers [34, 35] and hadronisa- tion (ME(2â†’n)@LO+PS). Examples are Alpgen [36], MadGraph [37] and Sherpa [38]. In 2002 an algorithm to merge the hard scattering based on a NLO ME for 2â†’2 processes with parton showers was developed (ME(2â†’2)@NLO+PS) [39] and MC generators implementing NLO accuracy for the inclusive underlying 2â†’2 process became available MC@NLO [39, 40] and PowHeg [41â€“44]. These MCs are presently the main tools used for data analysis. Recently, tools merging 2â†’n matrix elements to NLO accuracy (multi-jet merging) matched with PS were developed (ME(2â†’n)@NLO+PS). These tools are fully automated and are available in Mad- Graph5 aMC@NLO [45] and Sherpa 2 [46, 47]. They are presently commissioned by the LHC experiments. 5.

Measured kinematic vari- ables include the top transverse momentum (ptT), and the invariant mass (MttÂ¯), the rapidity (yttÂ¯) and transverse momentum (pTttÂ¯) of the ttÂ¯ system. The large available data sets allow for precise diï¬€erential measurements reaching high transverse momenta and masses. For instance, in a recent result using a data set of 12.1 fbâˆ’1 at âˆš s=8 TeV CMS has selected 76k ttÂ¯ events in the l+jets channel [49] and about 35k events in the dilep- ton channel [50] with a signal fraction of 80%. This is in contrast to about 2500 events in the most recent D0 measurement with a signal fraction of 75 % in the l+jets channel using a data set of 9.7 fbâˆ’1 [51]. Fig. 2 shows the ttÂ¯ cross section as a function of ptT as measured by ATLAS at âˆš s=7 TeV using an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fbâˆ’1 [48]. The data are well described for ptT   200 GeV by a NLO QCD calculation based on MCFM. For higher momenta the data fall below NLO QCD (by about 30% for ptT > 400 GeV). Fig. 3 shows the result from CMS [49] at âˆš s=8 TeV. The data are compared to the MadGraph to the PowHegMC simula- tion and to a NLO+NNLL calculation [52]. In this case the MC simulation fall below the data at high ptT, while the data are higher at low ptT. A CMS measurement atâˆš s=7 TeV leads to similar conclusions [53]. Both the ATLAS and CMS data are lower than the theory predictions at high ptT or high MttÂ¯. At low p t T the ATLAS data are in good agreement with NLO QCD, while the CMS data are higher and agree better with NLO+NNLL. The data agree only at the 2-3 Ïƒ level. Investigations to explain these diï¬€erences are on-going. Possible explanations for diï¬€erences seen at large ptT between data and theory are presently being investi- T.

These include a softer gluon distribution at large x as suggested by the better agreement of the NLO cal- culation using the HERAPDF, electro-weak corrections that can lower the QCD predictions by a few percent [54â€“56], higher order QCD eï¬€ects, or eï¬€ects related to parton shower or hadronisation. In this context it is in- teresting that PowHeg with Herwig as parton shower is able to describe the data. 6. Top pair ï¬�nal state ï¬�ducial measurements Measurements of ï¬�nal state observables are indis- pensable to assess and improve the modelling of ttÂ¯ events. They can be used to justify and reduce the systematic uncertainties associated to the ttÂ¯ modelling. They need to be deï¬�ned in a ï¬�ducial phase space re- gion close to the detector acceptance and corrected to the level of stable particles, jets and other physics ob- jects entering the detectors. The ï¬�rst ï¬�ducial ttÂ¯ measurement was published by ATLAS in 2012 [58] and was used to constrain the MC parameters controlling the additional parton radiation in ttÂ¯ events. [59, 60]. A new measurement was re- cently presented by CMS at âˆš s=7 TeV using a data set of 5 fbâˆ’1 [57]. Events are selected in the dilepton decay channel asking for two b-jets with pjetT > 30 GeV and |Î·| < 2.4. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm [61] with a distance parameter of R = 0.5. The additional jets are used to measure the gap fraction which is the probability to emit no jet above a certain pT cut in given Î· region.

The systematic variations encompass well the data. A similar measurement of the multiplicities of jets recon- structed with the anti-kt algorithm [61] using R = 0.4 with pT > 35 GeV and |Î·| < 2.4 was also published by ATLAS [62]. In addition also the pT spectra of the jets are measured in the l+jets channel. The leading jet pT is closely related to ptT, while the 4th leading jet is related to the pT of the ttÂ¯ system. These observables are shown in Fig. 5. As already observed for ptT, the PowHeg MC inter- faced with Pythia as well as Alpgen with lower value of Î±s tuned to describe the jet multiplicities [62] are higher than the data at large pT. However, the leading jet pT is well described by the MC@NLO MC interfaced with Herwig. This is consistent with the observation that the use of Herwig also leads to a good description of ptT. However, MC@NLO is lower than data at high val- ues of the 4th jet pT. The PowHeg MC with a changed parameter (hdamp) that controls the additional radiation can describe the data better and also gives a good de- scription of the jet multiplicities. In conclusion, well deï¬�ned ttÂ¯ ï¬�nal state measure- ments of ttÂ¯ are very important to assess and improve the MC modelling. This will increase the sensitivity to pro- cesses like the associated production of ttÂ¯ and the Higgs boson and for many searches of new particles beyond the SM exploiting high jet multiplicities or high pT. 7. Top mass measurement 7.1. Methods and interpretation The standard way to measure the top mass (mt) is to reconstruct the top decay products (W boson and b-quark) and to form the invariant mass. The measure- ment is calibrated using MC simulations and therefore it refers to mt as implemented in the MC simulations. The decay products are reconstructed using simple combina- tions of the physics objects in the event or more sophis- ticated techniques using kinematic ï¬�ts based on likeli- hoods (ATLAS) or a Ï‡2 metric (CMS). In the template method the reconstructed top mass is obtained from the reference MC for various top masses and the shape of this reference distribution is ï¬�tted to the mt distribution in the data. This method is used by ATLAS and CDF. In the ideogram method as, for in- stance, employed by CMS all good permutations of the physics objects are used to form mt. A likelihood func- tion tests the compatibility of the event kinematics with the top decay hypothesis. In the Matrix element method (e.g. D0) the LO cross section is used to calculate on an event-by-event basis signal and background probability densities for all parton-jet assignments. The simplest method only ï¬�ts mt (1D-ï¬�t). Most anal- yses use mt and a scale factor (JSF) that changes the T. Carli / Nuclear and Particle Physics Proceedings 273â€“275 (2016) 29â€“42 33 jet 4-vectors as ï¬�t parameter (2D-ï¬�t). The JSF factor is obtained by imposing that the two jets assigned to the W boson give the correct W boson mass. This factor constrains possible diï¬€erences in the jet energy mea- surement, e.g. due to ï¬‚avour diï¬€erences between the physics and calibration sample or residual data to MC diï¬€erences after jet calibration, as well as physics ef- fects like parton showers and hadronisation that alter the momentum when the quarks from the W boson trans- form to the jets formed from stable particles. ATLAS uses three ï¬�t parameters (3D-ï¬�t). In addition to mt and JSF a scale factor that changes the b-jets (bJSF) is con- strained using the ratio of the b-jet pT to the pT of the jets associated to the W boson. Top mass measurements methods reconstructing the top decay might suï¬€er from uncertainties of order of Î›QCD. There are also ongoing discussions how to inter- pret the MC-based results in terms of the mt parameter in the Standard Model Lagrangian. Recent reviews on the mass interpretation can be found in Refs. [63, 64]. It is therefore important to measure mt also with alter- native techniques like the comparison of QCD calcu- lations to the inclusive ttÂ¯ production cross section (see Section 7.3) or to observables based on ttÂ¯+jets [65]. De- terminations of mt from single top cross sections have presently lower sensitivity [66]. The use of well deï¬�ned theory cross sections for the mt determination allows to specify the renormalisation scheme. Therefore themt deï¬�nition is more transparent.

World combination and new measurements Top mass measurements have been carried out by the Tevatron experiments over the past decades. Im- proving the detector performance, the signal MC mod- elling and the measurement techniques the mt measure- ments became increasingly precise. In the year 2013 combinations of the most precise results of the Teva- tron experiments [67, 69] reached a relative precision of 0.5%. In parallel, the LHC experiments have become increasingly competitive with their latest measurements on the âˆš s=7 TeV data set and recent LHC combina- tions [70, 71] give a relative precision of 0.55%. In March 2014 the world combination of mt was car- ried out by the ATLAS, CMS, D0 and CDF collabora- tions [68]. The world average has been determined to: mt = 173.34 Â± 0.27 (stat.) Â± 0.71 (syst.) GeV. The relative precision achieved is 0.44%. Figure 6 shows a summary of the mt measurements entering in the world combination. The highest pre- cision is reached for the l+jets channel (0.46%), but also the dilepton channel (0.67%) and the fully hadronic channel (0.7%) give a good precision. The largest im- pact on the combination are carried by the CDF and the CMS measurements in the l+jets channel. Special care is applied to the estimate of the correla- tion of the systematic uncertainties. This is often dif- ï¬�cult and stability tests of the result under variations of the uncertainty assumptions are carried out. The largest eï¬€ect on mt is on the correlation assumption of the jet energy measurement uncertainty across the ex- periments, the ttÂ¯ ï¬�nal state modelling and the treatment of the hadronisation uncertainty. All three variations have an eï¬€ect on the combined mt on the level of 100 MeV. The overall consistency is good (Ï‡2 = 4/10) and all measurements have a pull below 1 except for the D0 l+jets measurement for which the pull is 1.2. Since the world average mt combination, several new measurements with high precision were published. The new measurements are summarised in Fig. 7.

The CMS l+jets mea- surement gives: mt = 172.04 Â± 0.19 (stat + JSF) Â± 0.75 (syst.) GeV. This corresponds to a precision of 0.45%. The fully hadronic channel gives: mt = 172.08 Â± 0.36 (stat + JSF) Â± 0.83 (syst.) GeV. with a precision of 0.53%. The most precise mt measurement was recently pub- lished by the D0 experiment [74]. This measure- ment was carried out as a blinded analysis. It selects 2500 events by requiring one lepton, four jets with one b-tagging and uses a leading order matrix element to calculate signal and background probability densities. The W boson mass constraint is exploited in a 2D ï¬�t. The D0 measurement gives: mt = 174.98 Â± 0.58 (stat. + JSF) Â± 0.49 (syst.) GeV corresponding to a precision of 0.45%. A recent Teva- tron combination [75] gives: 174.34 Â± 0.37 (stat.) Â± 0.52 (syst.) GeV with a precision of 0.37%. The overall consistency of the measurements is Ï‡2 = 10.8/11. In this combina- tion the D0 measurement has the largest weight (67.2 %) and has a pull with respect to the Tevatron average of 1.6. The second largest weight of 28.8% is carried by the CDF l+jets measurement with a pull of âˆ’1.64. Compared to the world average, the central value of this combination is 1.00 GeV higher. There is a clear tension between the two recent most precise mt measurements from D0 and from CMS (see Fig. 7). To quantify the signiï¬�cance of this tension needs a careful evaluation of the correlations of the sys- tematic uncertainties. Work is ongoing to understand the diï¬€erences, to cross check the employed mt mea- surement techniques and to review the MC modelling uncertainties and the uncertainties of the physics ob- jects. 7.3. Determination from inclusive ttÂ¯ cross section The top mass can also be determined by comparing a NNLO+NNLL QCD calculation to the inclusive cross section measurements (see Section 3). The precise AT- LAS cross section obtained by only selecting two lep- tons [26] has a particularly low dependence of the ex- perimental acceptance on mt used in the MC simula- tion.

The m pole t determination has a precision of 1.5%. The largest experimental sys- tematics is due to the luminosity that is uncorrelated forâˆš s=7 TeV and 8 TeV.

Single top cross section measurements Top quarks can also be singly produced via elec- troweak interactions. In leading order the production processes can be classiï¬�ed according to the exchange of the W boson or equivalently according to the primary electroweak Wtb-vertex: the t-channel (Wâˆ—b â†’ t) and the s-channel (Wâˆ— â†’ tb) process and the associated pro- duction of a W boson and a top quark (bâ†’ Wt). The single top production process has been ï¬�rst ex- perimentally established in proton anti-proton collisions at the Tevatron [78, 79]. In proton-proton collisions the single top-quark production was established ï¬�rst in the t-channel by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations atâˆš s=7 TeV [80, 81]. Evidence for the associatedWt pro- duction was also reported at âˆš s=7 TeV [82, 83]. The observation of this channel was reported by the CMS collaboration with a signiï¬�cance of more than ï¬�ve stan- dard deviations [84]. For s-channel production, so far only upper limits are given by the LHC experiments [85, 86], while the Tevatron experiments recently re- ported the observation of the s-channel [87]. At the LHC the single top quark production cross sec- tion is signiï¬�cantly higher. For the t-channel and the associated Wt production the signal can be well sepa- rated from the background. This allowed to measure the production cross sections separately for top and anti-top quarks and also to make the ï¬�rst ï¬�ducial and diï¬€erential measurements. 8.1. t-channel process The t-channel process dominates at the LHC. Atâˆš s=8 TeV it constitutes 82% of the total single top production cross section, while at Tevatron it is 65%. The tW production is 15% at LHC, while it is neg- ligible at the Tevatron. For the t-channel process re- cently an almost complete cross section calculation was carried out to NNLO accuracy [88]. The NNLO cal- culation for the total inclusive t-channel cross section gives ÏƒNNLO = 83.9+0.8âˆ’0.3 pb. For this process the NLO QCD corrections are only a few percent (+2.4%) and the NNLO corrections are small and negative (âˆ’1.6%). The quoted uncertainty refer to the variation of the renormal- isation and factorisation scale. The accuracy improves from 3.4% at NLO to 1% at NNLO. A new measurement of the inclusive t-channel cross section by the ATLAS experiment [89] measured sep- arately the top Ïƒtq and anti-top ÏƒtÂ¯q cross section atâˆš s=7 TeV and also the ratio Rt = Ïƒtq/ÏƒtÂ¯q: Ïƒtq = 46 Â± 1 (stat.)

Introduction  Cosmic rays are a sample of solar, galactic and  extragalactic matter which includes all stable charged  particles, nuclei and their isotopes. The main nuclear  components are protons (87%), Helium (12%) and  heavier nuclei (×½ 1%). A small fraction of electrons  (1%) and antimatter (positrons and antiprotons) is also  observed. The measurement of all particle cosmic ray  flux scales for more than 31 orders of magnitude in an  energy range from few eV to 1011 GeV/n. The  observed flux (see [1] and [2] and references included  there) is well described by a falling power law with a  spectral index Î³ ×½ 2.7 up to 106 GeV/n that steepens to  Î³ ×½ 3 at higher energies.  The composition and energy spectra of nuclei are  typically interpreted in the context of propagation  models. The cosmic ray particles, at least up to about  106 GeV, are considered of galactic origin and shock  waves of expanding supernovae remnants are good  candidates to supply the power for their acceleration.  The accelerated particles are injected into the  interstellar space where are coupled to the galactic  magnetic field and are diffused, both in momentum  and space, due to interactions with random galactic  magnetic fields. Particles are affected by  reacceleration, energy losses, nuclear interactions and  convective transport during the propagation in the  galactic medium. New particles and spallation  products are obtained by interaction of cosmic rays  particles with the interstellar matter. In this context,  protons and helium, as well as carbon, oxygen, iron  and other heavier nuclei produced and accelerated at  the astrophysical sources are considered as â€œprimaryâ€�  cosmic rays. Particles produced in the interaction of  the primaries with the interstellar medium or from the  decay of unstable species, are denoted as secondary  cosmic rays. The understanding of the origin,  acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays in the  Galaxy require the combination of different  measurements over a wide range of energy, including  chemical composition, anisotropy, and solar  modulation.  Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Nuclear and Particle Physics Proceedings 273â€“275 (2016) 110â€“116 2405-6014/Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. www.elsevier.com/locate/nppp http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2015.09.013 This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Cosmic ray composition and spectra have been  explored by direct measurements (balloon borne and  satellite experiments) up to 105 GeV and by indirect  methods (ground-based large-size apparatuses) at the  highest energies [2]. Considering the energy range  between few GeV/n and hundreds of TeV/n, and  mainly due to statistical limitations, the current  accuracy on the measurements does not allow  confirming or disproving a common spectral index of  the primary cosmic ray nuclei. Measurements of  secondary over primary cosmic ray are also affected  by backgrounds and uncertainties that limit the  precision on the determination of key parameters  needed in cosmic ray propagation models.   Electrons (and positrons) constitute about 1% of the  total cosmic-ray flux. Positrons are believed to have a  secondary origin, product of the interaction of primary  protons with the interstellar medium. The products of  these interactions include charged pions and kaons  which eventually decay producing equal number of  positrons and electrons with a soft spectrum. Within  this assumption, the positron fraction, defined as the  number o positrons over the total number of electrons  and positrons, is expected to decrease with the energy.  Since the very beginning of measurements of the  positron fraction, it became apparent a rise with the  energy above a few tens of GeV [3]-[16]. This  tendency has been confirmed with measurements  which extend the energy range up to 100 GeV [17].   This behavior suggests either the existence of a new  source of positrons, or a depletion of primary  electrons. Over the past two decades, there has been  strong interest in the cosmic ray positron fraction in  both particle physics and astrophysics [18]-[27]. There  are a number of models that provide primary sources  for electrons and positrons in the cosmic rays. In  particular, astrophysical sources (Pulsars, SNRs) and  WIMPs annihilation in the galactic halo have been  extensively proposed but the limited knowledge of the  cosmic ray production mechanisms and the  uncertainties in the parameters governing its  propagation makes hard to get to a clear conclusion.  Understanding the nature of the electron and  positron cosmic rays has become a priority subject in  the field. New experiments collecting high statistics  over a large dynamical range with good energy  resolution and a high background rejection capability  are required. Robust results can only be obtained by  experiments operating outside the atmosphere and  capable to measure simultaneously not only electrons  and positrons but also the experimental channels  required to understand and quantify the cosmic ray  background modeling.  In June 2006 the first of these  satellite, PAMELA, was launched in orbit by a Soyuz- U rocket from the Baykonur cosmodrome in  Kazakhstan, followed in June 2008 by Fermi on  satellite and, in May 2011, by AMS-02 on the  International Space Station  2. Space based cosmic ray experiments  2.1. PAMELA detector  The PAMELA experiment is performed from an  international collaboration including institutes and  universities from Italy, Russia, Germany and Sweden.    Fig. 1. Schematic view of PAMELA (left), Fermi-LAT (center) and AMS-02 (right) detectors.  J. Berdugo / Nuclear and Particle Physics Proceedings 273â€“275 (2016) 110â€“116 111  The core of the instrument (Fig. 1) is a permanent  magnetic spectrometer with a silicon microstrip tracker  that provides the rigidity, the sign and the charge of  the particles. The MDR (Maximum Detectable  Rigidity) is of the order of 1.2 TeV. The separation  between hadronic and leptonic components is made by  an imaging silicon-tungsten calorimeter, 16 radiation  length deep, able to measure electron energy up to 300  GeV with a resolution of a few percent. A neutron  counter and a thick scintillator, both placed above the  calorimeter improve the lepton/hadron discrimination.  The apparatus has a size of is 1.3m x 0.7m x 0.7m and  a geometrical acceptance of 21.5 cm2 sr. More  technical details can be found in [28]. PAMELA is  mounted on the upward-facing side of the Resurs-DK1  Russian satellite.  PAMELA has been put in a polar  elliptical orbit at an altitude between 350 and 610 km,  with an inclination of 70Â°.  Even if PAMELA was originally projected to have  a three-year mission, the detector is still operational  and making significant scientific contributions after  more than eight years. In 2009 the PAMELA  collaboration published the measurement of the  positron fraction up to 100 GeV [17]. A clear increase  of the positron fraction above 10 GeV appears in the  data (Fig. 2) confirming the indication present at lower  energy in previous experiments. PAMELA has  provided also the measurements of separated  positron  and electron fluxes up to 200 GeV and 625 GeV  respectively [29], [30].  2.2. Fermi-LAT detector  The Large Area Telescope (LAT) is the principal  scientific instrument on the Fermi Gamma Ray Space  Telescope spacecraft. The LAT scientific collaboration  includes more than 90 universities and laboratories  from 12 countries. The Fermi LAT is a gamma-ray  telescope (a pair-conversion telescope) covering a  measured energy range from 20 MeV to  300 GeV  with a field of view of about 20% of the sky. The  instrument is a 4 Ã— 4 array of identical towers, each  one consisting of a tracker and a segmented  calorimeter (8.6 radiation lengths) (Fig.1). The tracker  is covered with an anti-coincidence detector to reject  the charged-particle background. Further details on the  LAT, its performance, and calibration are given at  [31].The LAT is 0.72 m deep and 1.8 m square. Fermi  was launched on 11 June 2008 from Cape Canaveral  onboard a Delta rocket. Fermi resides in a low-earth  circular orbit at an altitude of 550 km, and at an  inclination of 28.5 degrees. The duration of the  mission has been extended till 2018.   Although FermiÂ´s main scientific goal is gamma ray  astronomy, LAT is a good instrument for electron  detection and it has been used to measure the  combined electron and positron spectrum from 7 GeV  to 1 TeV [32]. Although LAT is not equipped with a  magnet, the collaboration has use the shadow imposed  by the Earth and its offset direction for electrons and  positrons due to the geomagnetic field, to separately  measure the spectra of cosmic ray electrons and  positrons from 20 GeV to 200 GeV [33] (Fig. 2).  2.3. AMS-02 detector  Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) is a  general purpose high energy particle detector that has  been was installed on the International Space Station  on May 19, 2011 as part of station Utilization and  Logistics Flight ULF6 on shuttle flight STS-134. It  was transferred from the shuttle cargo bay using the  shuttle's robotic arm and handed off to the station's  robotic arm for installation. AMS-02 is mounted on  top of the Integrated Truss Structure, on USS-02, the  zenith side of the S3-element of the truss. AMS is an  international collaboration of about 500 scientists from    Fig. 2. The positron fraction (top) and electron and positron fluxes  (bottom)  measured by PAMELA and FERM-LAT compared with  previous results.  J. Berdugo / Nuclear and Particle Physics Proceedings 273â€“275 (2016) 110â€“116112 56 Institutes of USA, Asia and Europe. The layout of  the detector is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of 9 planes  of precision silicon tracker; a transition radiation  detector, TRD; four planes of time of flight counters,  TOF; a permanent magnet; an array of anti- coincidence counters, ACC, surrounding tracker layers  2 to 8, the inner tracker; a ring imaging Cerenkov  detector, RICH; and an electromagnetic calorimeter,  ECAL. The maximum detectable rigidity over tracker  planes 1â€“9 is ×½2TV. The apparatus has a size of is 5m  x 4m x 3m and a geometrical acceptance is 0.5 m2 sr.  Detector performance, described in detail in [34] is  steady over time.  In April 2013, the first AMS result was published in  Physical Review Letters [35]. The measurement was  based on data from the first 18 months of AMS  operations. Of the 25 billion cosmic ray events  analyzed, a number of 6.4 million were  unambiguously identified as electrons and 400,000 as  positrons. The precision measurement of the positron  fraction in primary cosmic rays, in the energy range  from 0.5 to 350 GeV was reported. The data (Fig. 3)  show that the fraction steadily increases from 10 to  ~250 GeV, but, from 20 to 250 GeV, the slope  decreases by an order of magnitude. The positron  fraction exhibits no fine structure, time dependence  nor observable anisotropy indicating the energetic  positrons are not coming from a preferred direction in  space.   AMS has continued collecting data at a rate of 16  million of events per year. New results, based on the  analysis of data collected during the first 30 months of  operation on the International Space Station have been  reported during this conference [36] and are discussed  in the coming section.  3. Lepton cosmic rays: new results from AMS  Three main detectors provide a clean and redundant  identification of positrons and electrons with  independent suppression of the proton background in  AMS [35]. These are the TRD (above the magnet), the  ECAL (below the magnet) and the tracker. To  differentiate between electrons and protons in the  TRD, signals from the 20 layers of proportional tubes  are combined in a TRD estimator formed from the  ratio of the log-likelihood probability of the electrons  hypothesis to that of the proton hypothesis in each  layer. The proton rejection power of the TRD  estimator at 90% electron efficiency measured on orbit  is 103 to 104. To cleanly identify electrons and  positrons in the ECAL, an estimator, based on a  boosted decision tree algorithm, is constructed using  the 3D shower shape in the ECAL. The proton  rejection power of the ECAL estimator reaches 104  when combined with the energy-momentum matching  requirement E/p > 0.75. The entire detector has been  extensively calibrated in a test beam at CERN with  positrons and electrons from 10 to 290 GeV/c, with  protons at 180 and 400 GeV/c, and with pions from 10  to 180 GeV/c which produce transition radiation  equivalent to protons up to 1.2 TeV/c. In total,  measurements with 18 different energies and particles  at 2000 positions were performed.  To assure long-term stability of the detector  response, the variations of the environmental  conditions along the orbits have been taken into  account. On-board calibrations of all channels are  performed every half-orbit (×½46 min) and off-line  calibrations of the TRD, TOF, tracker and ECAL are  performed every Â¼ of the orbit. Different corrections,  including the variations of the relative alignment of the  detectors and temperature dependence of the magnetic  field, are determined from specific samples of events  (mainly protons) and applied to the data.   The energy scale is verified by using minimum  ionizing particles and the ratio E/p and compared with  test beam values were the beam energy is known to  high precision. The response of the detector has been  studied with a Monte Carlo sample of events based on  a GEANT-4.9.4 simulation of the detector.   Over 41 billion events have been analysed and the  kinematic variables have been reconstructed with  algorithms that have been optimized using the test  beam data. The basic sample of events for lepton  analysis has been selected requiring a track in the TRD  and the Silicon Tracker, a cluster of hits in the ECAL  and a measured velocity Î² ~ 1 in the TOF consistent  with a downward-going Z=1 particle.    Fig. 3. The AMS measure positron fraction compared with the most  recent measurements from other experiments. The error bars for  AMS are the quadratic sum of the statistical and systematic  uncertainties.  J. Berdugo / Nuclear and Particle Physics Proceedings 273â€“275 (2016) 110â€“116 113  3.1. Positron fraction  Protons are the main potential source of  contamination and more than 99% of them are rejected  with an energy dependent cut on the ECAL estimator.  An additional potential contamination comes from  electrons and positrons produced by the interaction of  cosmic rays with the atmosphere. They are removed  requiring that the measured energy in the ECAL  exceeds by a factor of 1.2 the maximum StÃ¸rmer cut- off at each geomagnetic position of the detector.  The resulting acceptance for electrons and positrons  is identical and nearly constant over the range from 3  to 500 GeV and cancels in the measurement of the  positron fraction.  The positron fraction is determined in ECAL  energy bins. To maximize the sensitivity of the  measurement, a 2-dimensional fit to the positron  fraction was performed in each energy bin in the  (TRD-estimator, log(E/p)) plane. The fit is performed  for positive and negative rigidity data samples  yielding, respectively, the numbers of positrons and  electrons. From the bin-by-bin fits, the sample  contains 10.9 Ã— 106 primary positrons and electrons of  which 0.64 Ã— 106 are identified as positrons [37].  The behaviour of the positron fraction is shown in  Fig. 4. The new AMS data provides a significant  increase of statistics and extends the energy range to  500 GeV.  Above ×½200 GeV the positron fraction is  no longer increasing with energy and reaches a  maximum at 275 Â± 32 GeV. This is the first  experimental evidence of the existence of a new  behaviour of the positron fraction at high energy.  The overall behaviour of the positron fraction with  the energy can be described fitting the observations  with a simple minimal model that contains a diffuse  power law spectrum and a common source term with  an exponential cut-off parameter ES:     e S SÎ³ Î³ /E Se e Î¦ C E C E Ee                      e S SÎ³ Î³ /E Se e Î¦ C E C E Ee                    with E in GeV and where the coefficients Ce+ and  Ce- correspond to the relative weights of the diffuse  spectra for positrons and electrons, CS to the weight of  the source spectrum,  e+,  e- and  S are the  corresponding spectral indices and Es is the  characteristic cut-off energy for the source spectrum.  A fit of this model to the data in the energy range from  1 to 500 GeV yields a (Ï‡2 / dof = 36.4/58) a cut-off  parameter of  1/ES = 1.84 Â± 0.58 TeV-1 with Ce+/Ceâˆ’ =  0.091 Â±  0.001,  Cs/Ce= 0.0061 Â±  0.0009, Î³eâˆ’ âˆ’ Î³e+ =  âˆ’0.56 Â±  0.03 and Î³eâˆ’ âˆ’ Î³s =0.72 Â±  0.04. The resulting  fit is shown in Fig. 5 as a solid curve together with the  68% C.L. range of the fit parameters. No fine  structures are observed in the data.  Primary sources of cosmic ray positrons and  electrons may induce some degree of anisotropy on the  observed ratio of positron to the electron fluxes.  To  search for possible anisotropies, the arrival directions  of electrons and positrons are used to build a sky map  in galactic coordinates (b,l) and the observed positron  fraction is described by a spherical harmonic  expansion      l e l l l=0 m=-le r (b,l) -1= b, l <r 2m m a Y                              where Â”Â‡áˆºÂ„Ç¡ÂŽáˆ» denotes the positron ratio at (b,l), ÛƒÂ”Â‡Û„ is  the average ratio over the sky map, à¯ŸÜ»à¯  the real  spherical harmonics and Ü½à¯Ÿà¯  are the corresponding   coefficients. The angular power spectrum for a given l  is defined as      Fig. 5.

In  particular, with a 95% confidence level we set an  upper limit for a dipole anisotropy of        13 / 4 0.036C       .  3.2. Electron and Positron fluxes    The isotropic fluxes of cosmic-ray electrons and  positrons in the energy bin E of width ÈŸ   are given by                           e e eff trig N E Î¦ E A E  Îµ E  E  Î”ET           where  à­£àµ‡áˆº áˆ» is the number of electrons or  positrons,  É‚à­²à­°à­§à­¥áˆº áˆ» the trigger efficiency determined  from Monte Carlo simulations (100% above 3 GeV  decreasing to 75% at 1 GeV),  Ü¶áˆº áˆ» the exposure time  determined by counting the live time weighted number  of seconds at each location where the geomagnetic cut- off requirement is satisfied and  à­£à­¤à­¤áˆº áˆ» is the effective  acceptance detrmined from Monte Carlo and defined  as         eff geom sel idA A   Îµ   Îµ 1 Î´         with  à­¥à­£à­­à­« is the geometric acceptance (=550 cm 2  sr for this analysis),  É‚à­±à­£à­ª and  É‚à­§à­¢  the selection and  identification efficiencies for electrons and positrons  and É� a small correction to account for the effect of the  cuts on the kinematical variables. The sample of  electrons and positrons has been selected applying cuts  on the E/p matching and the maximum depth of the  reconstructed shower to reduce the proton background.    After applying further cuts on the ECAL and the  TRD,  a total of  9.23 Ã— 106 events have been identified  as electrons and 0.58 Ã— 106 as positrons [38]. The  analysis has been repeated 30 times by different  groups with different selection and identification cut  values and the results of the analysis were found to be  consistent. Furthermore, the time dependence of the  counting rates has been studied showing a good  stability for energies above 10 GeV and consistency  with solar modulation effects at lower energies. The  measured electron and positron flux, scaled by E3 is  shown in Fig. 6, together with the most recent  measurements for comparison. The measurements  cover the energy ranges of 0.5 to 700 GeV for  electrons and 0.5 to 500 GeV for positrons. Between  20 GeV and 200 GeV, where the effects of solar  modulation are insignificant within the current  experimental accuracy, the electron flux decreases  more rapidly with energy than the positron flux in a  manner that is not consistent with only the secondary  production of positrons; that is, the differing behavior  of the spectral indices versus energy indicates that  high-energy positrons have a different origin from that  of electrons.  3.3. Flux of electrons and positrons  The main experimental advantage of analyzing all  electrons together (as opposed to the positron fraction  or individual positron and electron fluxes) is that there  is no requirement on charge identification and,  therefore, it is possible to extend the measurement to  higher energies within limited systematic errors.  Following similar analysis procedures as those  described in the previous sections, a sample of 10.5  million events have been identified as electrons or  positrons in the energy range from 0.5 to 1000 GeV.        Fig. 6. The AMS electron (top) and positron (bottom) fluxes,  multiplied by E3. Statistical and systematic uncertainties of the AMS  results have been added in quadrature. Previous measurements from  other experiments are also shown for comparison.  J. Berdugo / Nuclear and Particle Physics Proceedings 273â€“275 (2016) 110â€“116 115  The measured flux multiplied by E3 is shown in  Fig. 7 as a function of the reconstructed energy at the  top of the AMS detector. Previous measurements from  balloon, space and ground based experiments are also  reported in the figure for comparison. No evidence has  been found of prominent features in the measured  spectrum and this result, together with the accurate  measurement of the positron fraction [37], clearly  indicates the need for an additional source of electrons  and positrons whose contribution to the flux is  particularly relevant in the high energy part of the  spectrum.    4. Summary remarks  For the last decades, cosmic ray composition and  spectra have been measured with low statistics and  severe background limitations. With the operation of  long term space based experiments, as PAMELA,  Fermi-LAT and AMS, a new set of high precision  measurements is available to deeper understand this  field as well as to search for new physics and  astrophysics  phenomena.  After 40 months of operations in space, AMS has  collected 54 billion cosmic ray events. To date 41  billion have been analyzed. Over the lifetime of the  space station, AMS is expected to measure hundreds  of billions of primary cosmic rays. Among the physics  objectives of AMS is the search for antimatter, dark  matter, and the origin of cosmic rays.     References  [1] P. Mertsch.

Summary remarks  For the last decades, cosmic ray composition and  spectra have been measured with low statistics and  severe background limitations. With the operation of  long term space based experiments, as PAMELA,  Fermi-LAT and AMS, a new set of high precision  measurements is available to deeper understand this  field as well as to search for new physics and  astrophysics  phenomena.  After 40 months of operations in space, AMS has  collected 54 billion cosmic ray events. To date 41  billion have been analyzed. Over the lifetime of the  space station, AMS is expected to measure hundreds  of billions of primary cosmic rays. Among the physics  objectives of AMS is the search for antimatter, dark  matter, and the origin of cosmic rays.     References  [1] P. Mertsch.

S2405601415005416.xml,"Recent Highlights from VERITAS R. Mukherjee for the VERITAS Collaboration Department of Physics and Astronomy, Barnard College, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 Abstract VERITAS is a ground-based gamma-ray observatory consisting of an array of four atmospheric Cherenkov tele- scopes located in southern Arizona, USA. VERITAS carries out an extensive observation program of the gamma-ray sky at energies above 0.1 TeV. Observations of Galactic and extragalactic sources in the TeV band are sensitive probes of the highly energetic processes occurring in these objects. Observations by VERITAS of the Galactic center and nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies provide constraints on particle dark matter with masses above a few hundred GeV. VERITAS observations also provide constraints on fundamental physics and cosmology, such as probing the history of galaxy formation and studying Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). The majority of the sources detected by VERI- TAS are active galactic nuclei (AGN), with gamma-ray emission originating in their relativistic jets. TeV observations of AGN help us constrain models of particle acceleration and energy dissipation in relativistic jets, and the size and location of the gamma-ray emission region. Galactic sources at TeV energies include supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, and binary systems, and TeV emission is a key diagnostic of the highly energetic particles in these objects. VERITAS observations provide important clues on the origin of cosmic rays and on particle acceleration in supernova blast shocks and relativistic pulsar wind-termination shocks. In this article I will present some highlights of particle-astrophysics measurements made with VERITAS. 1. Introduction: VERITAS VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Tele- scope Array System) is an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array consisting of four 12m- diameter telescopes of Davies-Cotton design, located at the base camp of the Fred Lawrence Whipple Obser- vatory (FLWO) in southern Arizona. VERITAS uses ground-based detection techniques to explore the Uni- verse in very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from 85 GeV to 30 TeV. Each VERITAS telescope has a cam- era at its focal plane comprising 499 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) arranged in a hexagonal pattern and has a ï¬�eld of view of diameter 3.5â—¦. Cherenkov light gen- erated in gamma-ray or cosmic-ray showers in the at- mosphere is focused on the camera to form an image of the shower. Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) such as VERITAS utilize the Cherenkov light emitted from air showers to form an image on the cam- era plane that has information on the longitudinal and lateral development of the air shower. Cosmic rays also produce showers of charged particles and Cherenkov ra- diation but at a rate much higher than that of gamma-ray showers, and constitute the principal source of back- ground. Using the four VERITAS telescopes in com- bination helps in obtaining a stereoscopic image of the particle showers to reduce cosmic ray background. VERITAS has an angular resolution of < 0.1â—¦ (68% containment) at 1 TeV and an energy resolution of 15% - 20%. Figure 1 is a photograph of the VERITAS ob- servatory, showing the array of four telescopes. Further details of the VERITAS telescopes are provided else- where [1]. VERITAS started four-telescope operations in 2007 and has since then undergone a series of upgrades and Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Nuclear and Particle Physics Proceedings 273â€“275 (2016) 367â€“372 2405-6014/Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. www.elsevier.com/locate/nppp http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2015.09.052 This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

In 2009 one of the telescopes was relocated to provide a more symmetric array layout. This rearrangement together with a new alignment sys- tem which improved the instrument point spread func- tion [3] allowed for a 30% improvement in sensitivity. In the summer of 2012 the VERITAS cameras were re- placed with new photomultiplier tubes with peak quan- tum eï¬ƒciency of greater than 32% [4] that increased the photon detection eï¬ƒciency of each camera by approxi- mately 50%. VERITAS is able to detect a source with a Crab Nebula-like spectrum and a ï¬‚ux of 1% Crab Neb- ula strength in about 25 hours. VERITAS now typically collects more than 1100 hours of data per year (includ- ing 200 hours data taken in moderate moonlight). VER- ITAS is normally operated using the full four-telescope array. A multi-level trigger system is employed to elim- inate background noise at the array-level. A trigger re- quires simultaneous Cherenkov images in at least two telescopes, within a 50 ns time window, which then causes a readout of the 500 MSample/s Flash-ADC data acquisition system for each pixel. VERITAS observations target a rich variety of sci- ence at energies greater than 85 GeV, including funda- mental physics and cosmology, as well as Galactic and extragalactic astrophysics. The origin of the highest en- ergy cosmic rays remains a mystery and neutral mes- sengers such as gamma rays and neutrinos are perhaps the best probes for directly observing cosmic acceler- ators. Observations performed with VERITAS have led and will continue to lead to signiï¬�cant progress in our understanding of the accelerators of very high energy particles in the Universe. VERITAS observa- tions are complementary to observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the Gamma- Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) at lower energies, and to the High AltitudeWater Cherenkov (HAWC) Experiment at higher energies. While IACTs have small ï¬�elds-of-view (FOVs), they have the advantage of large eï¬€ective ar- eas and the ability to achieve better source localization Figure 2: The diï¬€erential sensitivity of Fermi (green), VERI- TAS/HESS (cyan), and HAWC (solid blue) over four decades of en- ergy from 1 GeV to 100 TeV.

Fig- ure 2 shows the diï¬€erential sensitivities of the diï¬€erent gamma-ray experiments currently in use and planned for the future [5]. The combined sensitivities from âˆ¼ 300 MeV to 100 TeV allows complementary studies to probe some particle physics processes in the Universe. In this article, we review some of the recent results from VERITAS. 2. Science with VERITAS The VERITAS science program is based on four themes of scientiï¬�c exploration: (a) particle physics and fundamental laws, (b) cosmology, (c) black holes and (d) galactic tevatrons and pevatrons. Summaries of the VERITAS science goals addressing fundamen- tal physics topics and details of the long-term program related to the indirect detection of dark matter were recently presented in two white papers [6, 8] that de- scribe the critical role that the VERITAS Observatory will play in the future of the U.S Cosmic Frontier pro- gram. Fundamental physics topics of interest include studies of antimatter, the search for primordial black holes, study of cosmology utilizing unique probes of the extragalactic background light (EBL) & and the inter- galactic magnetic ï¬�eld (IGMF), & Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). VERITAS also plays an important role in multi-messenger astrophysics and has the capability to complement the results being produced by ultra high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) instruments such as Auger and neutrino observatories such as IceCube. In the fol- lowing we present a brief (and incomplete) summary of a few selected results; we refer the reader to the compi- R. Mukherjee / Nuclear and Particle Physics Proceedings 273â€“275 (2016) 367â€“372368 lations of articles presented at the recent ICRC [9] for a more compete description of VERITAS results. 2.1. Dark Matter Studies Indirect dark matter searches constitutes a substan- tial fraction of the VERITAS observations. VERITAS dark matter searches are motivated by the compelling evidence for the presence of non-baryonic dark matter in various structures of the Universe. Weakly interact- ing massive particles (WIMPs) in the mass range of 50 GeV - 10 TeV are well motivated dark matter candidates in extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics (supersymmetry, Kaluza-Klein). The neutralino, the lightest SUSY particle, is the most commonly used can- didate and self-annihilates to produce gamma rays. VERITAS observes a variety of dark matter targets with the goal of selecting the best candidates depend- ing on the mass to light ratio, distance and astrophysical background levels. VERITAS dark matter targets in- clude (a) the Galactic Center, which although a nearby source and a strong dark matter candidate, has the need to characterize well the large astrophysical gamma-ray background. (b) Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs): These are gravitationally bound objects with large mass to light ratios, that are believed to contain up to O(1000) times more mass in dark matter than in visible matter, making them widely discussed as potential targets for indirect dark matter detection. Although these are at- tractive targets with no gamma-ray background, their dark matter distribution can be uncertain, which can pose a challenge. (c) Unidentiï¬�ed Fermi-LAT sources: These are Fermi-detected gamma-ray sources with no known counterparts at other wavelengths. It is likely that the Galactic ones are local and could potentially be candidates for dark matter targets, although their na- ture and distance are unknown. (d) Galaxy Clusters: These have the largest dark matter concentration in the Universe, but their distance is large, the sources are ex- tended and the gamma-ray signal weak. Here we dis- cuss a few of the results from observations of dSphs; for more detailed reviews on the VERITAS dark matter results, see [6, 11]. Figure 3 shows the VERITAS 95% conï¬�dence level limits on the dark matter velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section <Ïƒv > for ï¬�ve dSphs observed with VER- ITAS: Segue 1, Ursa Minor, Draco, Bootes and Will- man 1. The ï¬�gure represents 48 hours of data on Segue I and âˆ¼ 15âˆ’20 hrs on the other targets [6]. Figure 4 shows the 95% conï¬�dence level upper limits from the VERI- TAS observations of Segue 1 on the WIMP < Ïƒv > as a function of the WIMP mass, considering diï¬€erent ï¬�nal state particles. The grey band area represents a range of Figure 3: Results from VERITAS observations of dSphs on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section < Ïƒv > as a function of WIMP mass.

(2013) [6]. generic values for the annihilation cross-section in the case of thermally produced dark matter. Although the VERITAS 95% limits are âˆ¼ 2 orders of magnitude away from the canonical cross section, VERITAS results do constrain some models which predict large boosts, both astrophysical in nature from clumping of dark matter within the galaxy and from particle physics processes (i.e. Sommerfeld enhancements) [10]. With continued observations in the future, VERI- TASwill provide increased sensitivity to neutralino dark Figure 4: 95% CL exclusion curves from the VERITAS observations of Segue 1 on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section < Ïƒv > as a function of the dark matter particle mass, in the framework of models with a Sommerfeld enhancement.

Figure 5 shows the projected VERITAS dark matter sensitivity limits from a stacked dSph analysis using data collected through the end of the 2013 observ- ing season and data expected through the 2018 observ- ing season. The power of a stacking analysis is that it al- lows for a single constraint to be derived from multiple observations. The stacking analysis technique and the predicted constraints from a fully completed VERITAS dark matter program are described elsewhere [6, 12]. 2.2. LIV Tests with Pulsars The detection of pulsed emission from the Crab pul- sar above 100 GeV by the VERITAS collaboration [13] provided the opportunity to probe physics at the Planck scale and constrain LIV eï¬€ects with a sensitivity that is competitive with some of the best available limits. Fig- ure 6 shows the pulse proï¬�le of the Crab pulsar above 120 GeV measured with VERITAS, together with the pulse proï¬�le measured by Fermi-LAT above 100 MeV. Using this data, Otte [14] derived a one-sided 95% con- ï¬�dence level upper limit on the time diï¬€erence between the peak positions at 100 MeV and 120 GeV and placed a limit of ELIV âˆ¼ 3 Ã— 1017 GeV on the energy scale of LIV. 2.3. Astrophysics Results VERITAS spends more than 1100 hours per year on source observations. Fig. 7 shows a skymap of Figure 6: VERITAS (> 120 GeV) and Fermi-LAT (> 100 MeV) pulse proï¬�le of the Crab pulsar at gamma-ray energies. VERITAS data taken between 2007 and 2011 was used to make this plot [13, 16]. the VERITAS detections to date. The VERITAS ex- tragalactic source list is dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with ultra-relativistic jets (outï¬‚ows of parti- cles) pointed close to our line of sight. Observations of blazars at TeV energies probe the innermost regions of these powerful particle accelerators, where the bulk of their luminosity is emitted. In addition to understanding the astrophysics of relativistic jets in AGN, TeV obser- vations of blazars will be key to understanding the ori- gin of the highest energy cosmic rays [17]. TeV obser- vations of blazars also provide constraints on fundamen- tal physics and cosmology, such as probing the history of galaxy formation, studying the density and spectrum of the EBL [18], and the strength of the IGMFs [19]. A few recent highlights from the VERITAS observations of blazars are as follows: (a) Detection of rapid vari- ability in BL Lacertae, when the source was detected at a ï¬‚ux of 125% that of the Crab Nebula ï¬‚ux and ex- hibited rapid variability that placed constraints on the size of the emission region [20]; (b) measuring E > 0.1 TeV gamma rays from the blazar PKS 1424+240 out to a distance of at least 7.4 billion light-years (red shift > 0.6035) and carrying out deep, broadband observa- tions of the source [21]; (c) discovery of the new TeV source VER J0521+211, triggered by the detection of a cluster of high-energy photons in the data from the Fermi gamma-ray satellite [22]; (d) deepest ever obser- vation of the relatively distant (z=0.14) VHE blazar 1ES 0229+200 and a three year multi-wavelength study of the source [23]; and (e) long term observations of the blazar B2 1215+30 [24]. Figure 8 shows the broadband spectrum of VER J0521+211 during the VERITAS detection in 2009 [22]. The spectral energy distribution is typical of that for gamma-ray blazars, exhibiting a low energy bump due R.

The peak of the high-energy gamma-ray emission fromVER J0521+211 is between 10 and 200 GeV. A simple one- zone leptonic relativistic jet model explains the gamma- ray emission as due to synchrotron self-Compton ra- diation, assuming a particle dominated jet with a bulk Lorentz factor of 30, and requiring a relatively weak magnetic ï¬�eld of 0.01 G [22].

Summary The scientiï¬�c reach of VERITAS covers the study of both extragalactic and Galactic objects as well as the search for astrophysical dark matter. Some highlights from VERITAS were presented at this meeting. Dark matter studies continue to be a high priority for VER- ITAS. Ongoing observations of dark matter targets ac- count for a signiï¬�cant portion of the VERITAS observ- ing time. VERITAS is expected to continue to have a strong observing program. R.

[7] Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave AnVERITAS is a ground-based gamma-ray observatory consisting of an array of four atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes located in southern Arizona, USA. VERITAS carries out an extensive observation program of the gamma-ray sky at energies above 0.1 TeV. Observations of Galactic and extragalactic sources in the TeV band are sensitive probes of the highly energetic processes occurring in these objects. Observations by VERITAS of the Galactic center and nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies provide constraints on particle dark matter with masses above a few hundred GeV. VERITAS observations also provide constraints on fundamental physics and cosmology, such as probing the history of galaxy formation and studying Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). The majority of the sources detected by VERITAS are active galactic nuclei (AGN), with gamma-ray emission originating in their relativistic jets. TeV observations of AGN help us constrain models of particle acceleration and energy dissipation in relativistic jets, and the size and location of the gamma-ray emission region. Galactic sources at TeV energies include supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, and binary systems, and TeV emission is a key diagnostic of the highly energetic particles in these objects. VERITAS observations provide important clues on the origin of cosmic rays and on particle acceleration in supernova blast shocks and relativistic pulsar wind-termination shocks. In this article I will present some highlights of particle-astrophysics measurements made with VERITAS.CF2 White Paper: Status and Prospects of The VERITAS Indirect Dark Matter Detection ProgramThree-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Implications for CosmologyExclusion of canonical WIMPs by the joint analysis of Milky Way dwarfs with FermiThe Firm Redshift Lower Limit of the Most Distant TeV-Detected Blazar PKS 1424+240Spatially Resolving the Very High Energy Emission From MGRO J2019+37 with VERITAS"

Nanomaterial toxicity is currently investigated by extensive animal studies, but more and more emphasis has been put into However, responding to the constant pressure in developing reliable and efficient alternative screening methods, many studies tried to predict the potential ENMs effects Especially “environmental information processing” and “cellular processes” such as focal adhesion and cell adhesion were upregulated in BEAS-2B with several materials. It is known that induction of cell adhesion molecules, such as ICAM and VCAM are induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines, mediating leukocyte adhesion and extravasation (Nanomaterial suspensions were prepared by weighing the materials into glass tubes and diluting them with 1% FBS-PBS to a stock concentration of 1 mg/ml. The stock was sonicated 2 × 15 min in bath sonicator (Elmasonic, USA) at room temperature, and additional 15 min to MIT_MW, GNF and FUL particles. Dilutions were prepared to corresponding cell culture media (see below) supplemented with 1% FCS and sonicated for 15 min and vortexed before the exposures.Microarray data have been deposited in ArrayExpress database and are accessible through ArrayExpress accession numbers: E-MTAB-6396, E-MTAB-6396 and E-MTAB-6397.G.
